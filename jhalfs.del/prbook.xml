  <title>Foreword</title>

<para>My journey to learn and better understand Linux began 
back in 1998. I had just installed my first Linux distribution and had
quickly become intrigued with the whole concept and philosophy behind
Linux.</para>

<para>There are always many ways to accomplish a single task. The same can be
said about Linux distributions. A great many have existed over the years.  Some
still exist, some have morphed into something else, yet others have been
relegated to our memories.  They all do things differently to suit the needs of
their target audience.  Because so many different ways to accomplish the same
end goal exist, I began to realize I no longer had to be limited by any one
implementation. Prior to discovering Linux, we simply put up with issues in
other Operating Systems as you had no choice. It was what it was, whether you
liked it or not. With Linux, the concept of choice began to emerge.  If you
didn't like something, you were free, even encouraged, to change it.</para>

<para>I tried a number of distributions and could not decide on any one. They
were great systems in their own right. It wasn't a matter of right and
wrong anymore. It had become a matter of personal taste. With all that
choice available, it became apparent that there would not be a single
system that would be perfect for me. So I set out to create my own Linux
system that would fully conform to my personal preferences.</para>

<para>To truly make it my own system, I resolved to compile everything from
source code instead of using pre-compiled binary packages. This
<quote>perfect</quote> Linux system would have the strengths of various
systems without their perceived weaknesses. At first, the idea was rather
daunting. I remained committed to the idea that such a system could be
built.</para>

<para>After sorting through issues such as circular dependencies and compile-time
errors, I finally built a custom-built Linux system. It was fully
operational and perfectly usable like any of the other Linux systems out
there at the time. But it was my own creation. It was very satisfying to
have put together such a system myself. The only thing better would have
been to create each piece of software myself. This was the next best
thing.</para>

<para>As I shared my goals and experiences with other members of the Linux
community, it became apparent that there was a sustained interest in these
ideas. It quickly became plain that such custom-built Linux systems
serve not only to meet user specific requirements, but also serve as an
ideal learning opportunity for programmers and system administrators to
enhance their (existing) Linux skills. Out of this broadened interest, the
<emphasis>Linux From Scratch Project</emphasis> was born.</para>

<para>This Linux From Scratch book is the central core around that project. It
provides the background and instructions necessary for you to design and
build your own system. While this book provides a template that will result
in a correctly working system, you are free to alter the instructions to
suit yourself, which is, in part, an important part of this project. You
remain in control; we just lend a helping hand to get you started on your
own journey.</para>

<para>I sincerely hope you will have a great time working on your own Linux From
Scratch system and enjoy the numerous benefits of having a system that is
truly your own.</para>

  <title>Audience</title>

<para>There are many reasons why you would want to read this book. One of the
questions many people raise is, <quote>why go through all the hassle of manually
building a Linux system from scratch when you can just download and install
an existing one?</quote></para>

<para>One important reason for this project's existence is to help you learn
how a Linux system works from the inside out. Building an LFS system helps
demonstrate what makes Linux tick, and how things work together and depend on
each other. One of the best things that this learning experience can provide is
the ability to customize a Linux system to suit your own unique needs.</para>

<para>Another key benefit of LFS is that it allows you to have more control
over the system without relying on someone else's Linux implementation. With
LFS, you are in the driver's seat and dictate every aspect of the
system.</para>

<para>LFS allows you to create very compact Linux systems. When installing
regular distributions, you are often forced to install a great many
programs which are probably never used or understood. These programs waste
resources. You may argue that with today's hard drive and CPUs, such
resources are no longer a consideration. Sometimes, however, you are still
constrained by size considerations if nothing else. Think about bootable
CDs, USB sticks, and embedded systems. Those are areas where LFS can be
beneficial.</para>

<para>Another advantage of a custom built Linux system is security. By compiling
the entire system from source code, you are empowered to audit everything
and apply all the security patches desired. It is no longer necessary to
wait for somebody else to compile binary packages that fix a security hole.
Unless you examine the patch and implement it yourself, you have no
guarantee that the new binary package was built correctly and adequately
fixes the problem.</para>

<para>The goal of Linux From Scratch is to build a complete and usable
foundation-level system. If you do not wish to build your own Linux system
from scratch, you may nevertheless benefit from the information in this
book.</para>

<para>There are too many other good reasons to build your own LFS system to
list them all here. In the end, education is by far the most powerful of
reasons. As you continue in your LFS experience, you will discover the power
that information and knowledge truly bring.</para>

</sect1>

  <title>LFS Target Architectures</title>

<para>The primary target architectures of LFS are the AMD/Intel x86 (32-bit)
and x86_64 (64-bit) CPUs.  On the other hand, the instructions in this book are
also known to work, with some modifications, with the Power PC and ARM CPUs. To
build a system that utilizes one of these CPUs, the main prerequisite, in
addition to those on the next page, is an existing Linux system such as an
earlier LFS installation, Ubuntu, Red Hat/Fedora, SuSE, or other distribution
that targets the architecture that you have. Also note that a 32-bit
distribution can be installed and used as a host system on a 64-bit AMD/Intel
computer.</para>

<para>For building LFS, the gain of building on a 64-bit system
compared to a 32-bit system is minimal.
For example, in a test build of LFS-9.1 on a Core i7-4790 CPU based system,
using 4 cores, the following statistics were measured:</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><computeroutput moreinfo="none">Architecture Build Time     Build Size
32-bit       239.9 minutes  3.6 GB
64-bit       233.2 minutes  4.4 GB</computeroutput></screen>

<para>As you can see, on the same hardware, the 64-bit build is only 3% faster
and is 22% larger than the 32-bit build. If you plan to use LFS as a LAMP
server, or a firewall, a 32-bit CPU may be largely sufficient. On the other
hand, several packages in BLFS now need more than 4GB of RAM to be built
and/or to run, so that if you plan to use LFS as a desktop, the LFS authors
recommend building on a 64-bit system.</para>

<para>The default 64-bit build that results from LFS is considered a
<quote>pure</quote> 64-bit system. That is, it supports 64-bit executables
only. Building a <quote>multi-lib</quote> system requires compiling many
applications twice, once for a 32-bit system and once for a 64-bit system.
This is not directly supported in LFS because it would interfere with the
educational objective of providing the instructions needed for a
straightforward base Linux system. Some LFS/BLFS editors maintain a fork
of LFS for multilib, which is accessible at <ulink url="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/~thomas/multilib/index.html"/>. But it
is an advanced topic.</para>

  <title>Prerequisites</title>

  <para>Building an LFS system is not a simple task. It requires a certain
  level of existing knowledge of Unix system administration in order to resolve
  problems and correctly execute the commands listed. In particular, as an
  absolute minimum, you should already have the ability to use the
  command line (shell) to copy or move files and directories, list directory
  and file contents, and change the current directory. It is also expected that
  you have a reasonable knowledge of using and installing Linux
  software.</para>

  <para>Because the LFS book assumes <emphasis>at least</emphasis> this basic
  level of skill, the various LFS support forums are unlikely to be able to
  provide you with much assistance in these areas. You will find that your
  questions regarding such basic knowledge will likely go unanswered or you
  will simply be referred to the LFS essential pre-reading list.</para>

  <para>Before building an LFS system, we recommend reading the following:</para>

  <title>LFS and Standards</title>

  <!--<sect2>
    <title/> -->

     <para>The structure of LFS follows Linux standards as closely as
     possible.  The primary standards are:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><ulink url="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/">
        POSIX.1-2008</ulink>.</para>

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para><ulink url="http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/lsb.shtml">Linux
        Standard Base (LSB) Version 5.0 (2015)</ulink></para>

        <para>The LSB has four separate standards: Core, Desktop,
        Runtime Languages, and Imaging. In addition to generic requirements
        there are also architecture specific requirements.  There are also two
        areas for trial use: Gtk3 and Graphics.  LFS attempts to conform to the
        architectures discussed in the previous section.</para>

        <note><para>Many people do not agree with the requirements of the LSB.
        The main purpose of defining it is to ensure that proprietary software
        will be able to be installed and run properly on a compliant system.
        Since LFS is source based, the user has complete control over what
        packages are desired and many choose not to install some packages that
        are specified by the LSB.</para></note>

      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Creating a complete LFS system capable of passing the LSB
    certifications tests is possible, but not without many additional packages
    that are beyond the scope of LFS.  These additional packages have
    installation instructions in BLFS. </para>

  <title>Rationale for Packages in the Book</title>

    <para>As stated earlier, the goal of LFS is to build a complete and usable
    foundation-level system.  This includes all packages needed to replicate
    itself while providing a relatively minimal base from which to customize
    a more complete system based on the choices of the user.  This does not
    mean that LFS is the smallest system possible.  Several important packages
    are included that are not strictly required.  The lists below document the
    rationale for each package in the book.</para>

  <title>Typography</title>

  <para>To make things easier to follow, there are a few typographical
  conventions used throughout this book. This section contains some
  examples of the typographical format found throughout Linux From
  Scratch.</para>

<screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">./configure --prefix=/usr</userinput></screen>

  <para>This form of text is designed to be typed exactly as seen unless
  otherwise noted in the surrounding text. It is also used in the explanation
  sections to identify which of the commands is being referenced.</para>

  <para>In some cases, a logical line is extended to two or more physical lines
  with a backslash at the end of the line.</para>

<screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">CC="gcc -B/usr/bin/" ../binutils-2.18/configure \
  --prefix=/tools --disable-nls --disable-werror</userinput></screen>

  <para>Note that the backslash must be followed by an immediate return.  Other
  whitespace characters like spaces or tab characters will create incorrect
  results.</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><computeroutput moreinfo="none">install-info: unknown option '--dir-file=/mnt/lfs/usr/info/dir'</computeroutput></screen>

  <para>This form of text (fixed-width text) shows screen output, usually as
  the result of commands issued.  This format is also used to show filenames,
  such as <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/ld.so.conf</filename>.</para>

  <para><emphasis>Emphasis</emphasis></para>

  <para>This form of text is used for several purposes in the book. Its main
  purpose is to emphasize important points or items.</para>

  <para><ulink url="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/"/></para>

  <para>This format is used for hyperlinks both within the LFS community and to
  external pages. It includes HOWTOs, download locations, and websites.</para>

<screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">cat &gt; $LFS/etc/group &lt;&lt; "EOF"
<literal moreinfo="none">root:x:0:
bin:x:1:
......</literal>
EOF</userinput></screen>

  <para>This format is used when creating configuration files. The first command
  tells the system to create the file <filename moreinfo="none">$LFS/etc/group</filename> from
  whatever is typed on the following lines until the sequence End Of File (EOF)
  is encountered. Therefore, this entire section is generally typed as
  seen.</para>

  <para><replaceable>&lt;REPLACED TEXT&gt;</replaceable></para>

  <para>This format is used to encapsulate text that is not to be typed
  as seen or for copy-and-paste operations.</para>

  <para><replaceable>[OPTIONAL TEXT]</replaceable></para>

  <para>This format is used to encapsulate text that is optional.</para>

  <para><filename moreinfo="none">passwd(5)</filename></para>

  <para>This format is used to refer to a specific manual (man) page. The number inside parentheses
  indicates a specific section inside the manuals. For example,
  <command moreinfo="none">passwd</command> has two man pages. Per LFS installation instructions,
  those two man pages will be located at
  <filename moreinfo="none">/usr/share/man/man1/passwd.1</filename> and
  <filename moreinfo="none">/usr/share/man/man5/passwd.5</filename>. When the book uses <filename moreinfo="none">passwd(5)</filename> it is
  specifically referring to <filename moreinfo="none">/usr/share/man/man5/passwd.5</filename>.
  <command moreinfo="none">man passwd</command> will print the first man page it finds that
  matches <quote>passwd</quote>, which will be
  <filename moreinfo="none">/usr/share/man/man1/passwd.1</filename>. For this example, you will
  need to run <command moreinfo="none">man 5 passwd</command> in order to read the page
  being specified. Note that most man pages do not have duplicate
  page names in different sections. Therefore, <command moreinfo="none">man <replaceable>&lt;program
  name&gt;</replaceable></command> is generally sufficient.</para>

  <title>How to Build an LFS System</title>

  <para>The LFS system will be built by using an already installed
  Linux distribution (such as Debian, OpenMandriva, Fedora, or openSUSE). This
  existing Linux system (the host) will be used as a starting point to
  provide necessary programs, including a compiler, linker, and shell,
  to build the new system. Select the <quote>development</quote> option
  during the distribution installation to be able to access these
  tools.</para>

  <para>As an alternative to installing a separate distribution onto your
  machine, you may wish to use <!-- the Linux From Scratch LiveCD or --> a LiveCD from a
  commercial distribution. <!-- The LFS LiveCD works well as a host system,
  providing all the tools you need to successfully follow the instructions in
  this book. The LiveCD version is behind the current book, but is still useful
  as a host for building the current book.  The <quote>-nosrc</quote> or
  <quote>-min</quote> editions of the LiveCD are the most appropriate for
  building a current LFS system.  For more information about the LFS LiveCD or
  to download a copy, visit <ulink url="&livecd-root;"/>. --></para>

  <!--
  <note>
    <para>The LFS LiveCD might not work on newer hardware configurations,
    failing to boot or failing to detect some devices such as some SATA hard
    drives.</para>
  </note> -->

  <para><xref linkend="chapter-partitioning"/> of this book describes how
  to create a new Linux native partition and file system. This is the place
  where the new LFS system will be compiled and installed. <xref linkend="chapter-getting-materials"/> explains which packages and
  patches need to be downloaded to build an LFS system and how to store
  them on the new file system. <xref linkend="chapter-final-preps"/>
  discusses the setup of an appropriate working environment. Please read
  <xref linkend="chapter-final-preps"/> carefully as it explains several
  important issues you need be aware of before beginning to
  work your way through <xref linkend="chapter-cross-tools"/> and beyond.</para>

  <para><xref linkend="chapter-cross-tools"/>,  explains the installation of
  the initial tool chain, (binutils, gcc, and glibc) using cross compilation
  techniques to isolate the new tools from the host system.</para>

  <para><xref linkend="chapter-temporary-tools"/> shows you how to
  cross-compile basic utilities using the just built cross-toolchain.</para>

  <para><xref linkend="chapter-chroot-temporary-tools"/> then enters a
  "chroot" environment and uses the previously built tools to build
  the additional tools needed to build and test the final system.</para>

  <para>This effort to isolate the new system from the host distribution may
  seem excessive. A full technical explanation as to why this is done is
  provided in <xref linkend="ch-tools-toolchaintechnotes"/>.</para>

  <para>In <xref linkend="chapter-building-system"/>, The
  full LFS system is built. Another advantage provided by the chroot
  environment is that it allows you to continue using the host system
  while LFS is being built. While waiting for package compilations to
  complete, you can continue using your computer as normal.</para>

  <para>To finish the installation, the basic system configuration is set up in
  <xref linkend="chapter-config"/>, and the kernel and boot loader are set
  up in <xref linkend="chapter-bootable"/>. <xref linkend="chapter-finalizing"/>
  contains information on continuing the LFS experience beyond this book.
  After the steps in this book have been implemented, the computer will be
  ready to reboot into the new LFS system.</para>

  <para>This is the process in a nutshell. Detailed information on each
  step is discussed in the following chapters and package descriptions.
  Items that may seem complicated will be clarified, and everything will
  fall into place as you embark on the LFS adventure.</para>

  <title>What's new since the last release</title>

  <para>In this version of LFS, there has been a major reorganization
  of the book using techniques that avoid changing the host system
  and provides a more straight forward build process.</para>

  <para>Below is a list of package updates made since the previous
  release of the book.</para>

  <!--
    Every package in the book is listed in the "Upgraded to:" section.
    Comment/uncomment as needed. DO NOT delete any of these lines unless that
    package is removed from the book entirely.

  <title>Help</title>

  <para>If an issue or a question is encountered while working through

  Questions are often already answered there. If your question is not

  following hint will give you some guidance for troubleshooting:
  <ulink url="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/errors.txt"/>.</para>

  <para>If you cannot find your problem listed in the FAQ, search the mailing
  lists at <ulink url="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/search.html"/>.</para>

  <para>We also have a wonderful LFS community that is willing to offer
  assistance through the mailing lists and IRC (see the <xref linkend="ch-intro-resources"/> section of this book). However,
  we get several support questions every day and many of them can be easily
  answered by going to the FAQ and by searching the mailing lists first.
  So, for us to offer the best assistance possible, you need to do some
  research on your own first. That allows us to focus on the more unusual
  support needs. If your searches do not produce a solution, please include
  all relevant information (mentioned below) in your request for help.</para>

    <title>Things to Mention</title>

    <para>Apart from a brief explanation of the problem being experienced,
    the essential things to include in any request for help are:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The version of the book being used (in this case 
              <phrase revision="sysv">11.0</phrase>

    <note>
      <para>Deviating from this book does <emphasis>not</emphasis> mean that

    <title>Configure Script Problems</title>

    <para>If something goes wrong while running the <command moreinfo="none">configure</command>
    script, review the <filename moreinfo="none">config.log</filename> file. This file may
    contain errors encountered during <command moreinfo="none">configure</command> which were
    not printed to the screen. Include the <emphasis>relevant</emphasis> lines
    if you need to ask for help.</para>

  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>Compilation Problems</title>

    <para>Both the screen output and the contents of various files are useful
    in determining the cause of compilation problems. The screen output from
    the <command moreinfo="none">configure</command> script and the <command moreinfo="none">make</command>
    run can be helpful. It is not necessary to include the entire output, but
    do include enough of the relevant information. Below is an example of the
    type of information to include from the screen output from
    <command moreinfo="none">make</command>:</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><computeroutput moreinfo="none">gcc -DALIASPATH=\"/mnt/lfs/usr/share/locale:.\"
-DLOCALEDIR=\"/mnt/lfs/usr/share/locale\"
-DLIBDIR=\"/mnt/lfs/usr/lib\"
-DINCLUDEDIR=\"/mnt/lfs/usr/include\" -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I.
-g -O2 -c getopt1.c
gcc -g -O2 -static -o make ar.o arscan.o commands.o dir.o
expand.o file.o function.o getopt.o implicit.o job.o main.o
misc.o read.o remake.o rule.o signame.o variable.o vpath.o

-lutil job.o: In function `load_too_high':
/lfs/tmp/make-3.79.1/job.c:1565: undefined reference
to `getloadavg'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make[2]: *** [make] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/lfs/tmp/make-3.79.1'
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/lfs/tmp/make-3.79.1'
make: *** [all-recursive-am] Error 2</computeroutput></screen>

    <para>In this case, many people would just include the bottom
    section:</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><computeroutput moreinfo="none">make [2]: *** [make] Error 1</computeroutput></screen>

    <para>This is not enough information to properly diagnose the problem
    because it only notes that something went wrong, not
    <emphasis>what</emphasis> went wrong. The entire section, as in the
    example above, is what should be saved because it includes the command
    that was executed and the associated error message(s).</para>

    <para>An excellent article about asking for help on the Internet is
    available online at <ulink url="http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html"/>. Read and
    follow the hints in this document to increase the likelihood of getting
    the help you need.</para>

  <title>Host System Requirements</title>

    <para>Your host system should have the following software with the
    minimum versions indicated. This should not be an issue for most
    modern Linux distributions. Also note that many distributions will
    place software headers into separate packages, often in the form of
    <quote>&lt;package-name&gt;-devel</quote> or
    <quote>&lt;package-name&gt;-dev</quote>. Be sure to install those if
    your distribution provides them.</para>

      <para>If the host kernel is earlier than 3.2 you will need to replace
      the kernel with a more up to date version. There are two ways
      you can go about this. First, see if your Linux vendor provides a 3.2
      or later kernel package. If so, you may wish to install it. If your
      vendor doesn't offer an acceptable kernel package, or you would prefer not to
      install it, you can compile a kernel yourself. Instructions for
      compiling the kernel and configuring the boot loader (assuming the host
      uses GRUB) are located in <xref linkend="chapter-bootable"/>.</para>

  <title>Creating a New Partition</title>

  <para>Like most other operating systems, LFS is usually installed on a
  dedicated partition. The recommended approach to building an LFS system
  is to use an available empty partition or, if you have enough unpartitioned
  space, to create one.</para>

  <para>A minimal system requires a partition of around 10 gigabytes (GB).
  This is enough to store all the source tarballs and compile the packages.
  However, if the LFS system is intended to be the primary Linux system,
  additional software will probably be installed which will require additional
  space. A 30 GB partition is a reasonable size to provide for growth.  The LFS
  system itself will not take up this much room.  A large portion of this
  requirement is to provide sufficient free temporary storage as well as
  for adding additional capabilities after LFS is complete. Additionally, compiling
  packages can require a lot of disk space which will be reclaimed after the
  package is installed.</para>

  <para>Because there is not always enough Random Access Memory (RAM) available
  for compilation processes, it is a good idea to use a small disk partition as
  <systemitem class="filesystem" moreinfo="none">swap</systemitem> space. This is used by the
  kernel to store seldom-used data and leave more memory available for active
  processes. The <systemitem class="filesystem" moreinfo="none">swap</systemitem> partition for
  an LFS system can be the same as the one used by the host system, in which
  case it is not necessary to create another one.</para>

  <para>Start a disk partitioning program such as <command moreinfo="none">cfdisk</command>
  or <command moreinfo="none">fdisk</command> with a command line option naming the hard
  disk on which the new partition will be created—for example
  <filename class="devicefile" moreinfo="none">/dev/sda</filename> for the primary 
  disk drive. Create a Linux native partition and a
  <systemitem class="filesystem" moreinfo="none">swap</systemitem> partition, if needed. Please
  refer to <filename moreinfo="none">cfdisk(8)</filename> or <filename moreinfo="none">fdisk(8)</filename> if
  you do not yet know how to use the programs.</para>

  <note><para>For experienced users, other partitioning schemes are possible.
  The new LFS system can be on a software <ulink url="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/11.0/postlfs/raid.html">RAID</ulink> array or an <ulink url="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/11.0/postlfs/aboutlvm.html">LVM</ulink> logical volume.
  However, some of these options require an <ulink url="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/11.0/postlfs/initramfs.html">initramfs</ulink>, which is
  an advanced topic.  These partitioning methodologies are not recommended for
  first time LFS users.</para></note>

  <para>Remember the designation of the new partition (e.g., <filename class="devicefile" moreinfo="none">sda5</filename>). This book will refer to this as
  the LFS partition. Also remember the designation of the <systemitem class="filesystem" moreinfo="none">swap</systemitem> partition. These names will be
  needed later for the <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/fstab</filename> file.</para>

  <sect2>
  <title>Other Partition Issues</title>

  <para>Requests for advice on system partitioning are often posted on the LFS mailing
  lists. This is a highly subjective topic.  The default for most distributions
  is to use the entire drive with the exception of one small swap partition.  This
  is not optimal for LFS for several reasons.  It reduces flexibility, makes
  sharing of data across multiple distributions or LFS builds more difficult, makes
  backups more time consuming, and can waste disk space through inefficient
  allocation of file system structures.</para>

    <sect3>
    <title>The Root Partition</title>

    <para>A root LFS partition (not to be confused with the
    <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/root</filename> directory) of
    twenty gigabytes is a good compromise for most systems.  It provides enough
    space to build LFS and most of BLFS, but is small enough so that multiple
    partitions can be easily created for experimentation.</para> </sect3>

    <sect3>
    <title>The Swap Partition</title>

    <para>Most distributions automatically create a swap partition.  Generally
    the recommended size of the swap partition is about twice the amount of
    physical RAM, however this is rarely needed.  If disk space is limited,
    hold the swap partition to two gigabytes and monitor the amount of disk
    swapping.</para>

    <para>If you want to use the hibernation feature (suspend-to-disk) of Linux,
    it writes out the contents of RAM to the swap partition before turning off 
    the machine. In this case the size of the swap partition should be at
    least as large as the system's installed RAM.</para>

    <para>Swapping is never good. For mechanical hard drives you can generally
    tell if a system is swapping by just listening to disk activity and
    observing how the system reacts to commands.  For an SSD drive you will not
    be able to hear swapping but you can tell how much swap space is being used
    by the <command moreinfo="none">top</command> or <command moreinfo="none">free</command> programs.  Use of
    an SSD drive for a swap partition should be avoided if possible.  The first
    reaction to swapping should be to check for an unreasonable command such as
    trying to edit a five gigabyte file. If swapping becomes a normal
    occurrence, the best solution is to purchase more RAM for your
    system.</para> </sect3>

    <sect3>
    <title>The Grub Bios Partition</title>

    <para>If the <emphasis>boot disk</emphasis> has been partitioned with a
    GUID Partition Table (GPT), then a small, typically 1 MB, partition must be
    created if it does not already exist.  This partition is not formatted, but
    must be available for GRUB to use during installation of the boot
    loader. This partition will normally be labeled 'BIOS Boot' if using
    <command moreinfo="none">fdisk</command> or have a code of <emphasis>EF02</emphasis> if
    using <command moreinfo="none">gdisk</command>.</para>

    <note><para>The Grub Bios partition must be on the drive that the BIOS 
    uses to boot the system.  This is not necessarily the same drive where the 
    LFS root partition is located. Disks on a system may use different
    partition table types.  The requirement for this partition depends
    only on the partition table type of the boot disk.</para></note>
    </sect3>

    <sect3>
    <title>Convenience Partitions</title>

    <para>There are several other partitions that are not required, but should
    be considered when designing a disk layout.  The following list
    is not comprehensive, but is meant as a guide.</para>

    <itemizedlist>

      <listitem><para>/boot – Highly recommended.  Use this partition to
      store kernels and other booting information.  To minimize potential boot
      problems with larger disks, make this the first physical partition on
      your first disk drive.  A partition size of 200 megabytes is quite
      adequate.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>/home – Highly recommended.  Share your home
      directory and user customization across multiple distributions or LFS
      builds.  The size is generally fairly large and depends on available disk
      space.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>/usr – In LFS,
      <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/bin</filename>,
      <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/lib</filename>, and
      <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/sbin</filename> are symlinks to their
      counterpart in <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/usr</filename>.
      So <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/usr</filename> contains all binaries
      needed for the system to run.  For LFS a separate partition for
      <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/usr</filename> is normally not needed.
      If you need it anyway, you should make a partition large enough to
      fit all programs and libraries in the system.  The root partition can be
      very small (maybe just one gigabyte) in this configuration, so it's
      suitable for a thin client or diskless workstation (where
      <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/usr</filename> is mounted from a remote
      server).  However you should take care that an initramfs (not covered by
      LFS) will be needed to boot a system with separate
      <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/usr</filename> partition.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>/opt – This directory is most useful for
      BLFS where multiple installations of large packages like Gnome or KDE can
      be installed without embedding the files in the /usr hierarchy.  If
      used, 5 to 10 gigabytes is generally adequate.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem><para>/tmp – A separate /tmp directory is rare, but
      useful if configuring a thin client.  This partition, if used, will
      usually not need to exceed a couple of gigabytes.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>/usr/src – This partition is very
      useful for providing a location to store BLFS source files and
      share them across LFS builds.  It can also be used as a location
      for building BLFS packages.  A reasonably large partition of 30-50
      gigabytes allows plenty of room.</para></listitem>

    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Any separate partition that you want automatically mounted upon boot
    needs to be specified in the <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/fstab</filename>.  Details
    about how to specify partitions will be discussed in <xref linkend="ch-bootable-fstab"/>.  </para>

  <title>Creating a File System on the Partition</title>

  <para>Now that a blank partition has been set up, the file system can be
  created.  LFS can use any file system recognized by the Linux kernel, but the 
  most common types are ext3 and ext4.  The choice of file system can be 
  complex and depends on the characteristics of the files and the size of 
  the partition.  For example:</para>

  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>ext2</term>
      <listitem><para>is suitable for small partitions that are updated infrequently
      such as /boot.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>ext3</term>
      <listitem><para>is an upgrade to ext2 that includes a journal
      to help recover the partition's status in the case of an unclean 
      shutdown.  It is commonly used as a general purpose file system.
      </para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>ext4</term>
      <listitem><para>is the latest version of the ext file system family of
      partition types.  It provides several new capabilities including
      nano-second timestamps, creation and use of very large files (16 TB), and
      speed improvements.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>

  <para>Other file systems, including FAT32, NTFS, ReiserFS, JFS, and XFS are
  useful for specialized purposes.  More information about these file systems
  can be found at <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_systems"/>.</para>

  <para>LFS assumes that the root file system (/) is of type ext4.  To create
  an <systemitem class="filesystem" moreinfo="none">ext4</systemitem> file system on the LFS
  partition, run the following:</para>

<screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">mkfs -v -t ext4 /dev/<replaceable>&lt;xxx&gt;</replaceable></userinput></screen>

  <para>Replace <replaceable>&lt;xxx&gt;</replaceable> with the name of the LFS
  partition.</para>

  <para>If you are using an existing <systemitem class="filesystem" moreinfo="none">swap
  </systemitem> partition, there is no need to format it. If a new
  <systemitem class="filesystem" moreinfo="none"> swap</systemitem> partition was created,
  it will need to be initialized with this command:</para>

<screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">mkswap /dev/<replaceable>&lt;yyy&gt;</replaceable></userinput></screen>

  <para>Replace <replaceable>&lt;yyy&gt;</replaceable> with the name of the
  <systemitem class="filesystem" moreinfo="none">swap</systemitem> partition.</para>

  <title>Setting The $LFS Variable</title>

  <para>Throughout this book, the environment variable <envar>LFS</envar> will
  be used several times. You should ensure that this variable is always defined
  throughout the LFS build process. It should be set to the name of the
  directory where you will be building your LFS system - we will use
  <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/mnt/lfs</filename> as an example, but the
  directory choice is up to you. If you are building LFS on a separate
  partition, this directory will be the mount point for the partition.
  Choose a directory location and set the variable with the
  following command:</para>

<screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">export LFS=<replaceable>/mnt/lfs</replaceable></userinput></screen>

  <para>Having this variable set is beneficial in that commands such as
  <command moreinfo="none">mkdir -v $LFS/tools</command> can be typed literally. The shell
  will automatically replace <quote>$LFS</quote> with
  <quote>/mnt/lfs</quote> (or whatever the variable was set to) when it
  processes the command line.</para>

  <caution>
  <para>Do not forget to check that <envar>LFS</envar> is set whenever
  you leave and reenter the current working environment (such as when doing a
  <command moreinfo="none">su</command> to <systemitem class="username" moreinfo="none">root</systemitem> or
  another user). Check that the <envar>LFS</envar> variable is set up
  properly with:</para>

<screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">echo $LFS</userinput></screen>

  <para>Make sure the output shows the path to your LFS system's build
  location, which is <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/mnt/lfs</filename> if the
  provided example was followed. If the output is incorrect, use the command
  given earlier on this  page to set <envar>$LFS</envar> to the correct
  directory name.</para>
  </caution>

  <note><para>One way to ensure that the <envar>LFS</envar> variable is always
  set is to edit the <filename moreinfo="none">.bash_profile</filename> file in both your
  personal home directory and in  <filename moreinfo="none">/root/.bash_profile</filename> and
  enter the export command above.  In addition, the shell specified in the
  <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/passwd</filename> file for all users that need the
  <envar>LFS</envar> variable needs to be bash to ensure that the
  <filename moreinfo="none">/root/.bash_profile</filename> file is incorporated as a part of
  the login process.</para>
  
  <para>Another consideration is the method that is used to log into the
  host system.  If logging in through a graphical display manager, the
  user's <filename moreinfo="none">.bash_profile</filename> is not normally used when
  a virtual terminal is started.  In this case, add the export command to
  the <filename moreinfo="none">.bashrc</filename> file for the user and
  <systemitem class="username" moreinfo="none">root</systemitem>.  In addition, 
  some distributions have instructions to not run the <filename moreinfo="none">.bashrc</filename> 
  instructions in a non-interactive bash invocation.  Be sure to add the
  export command before the test for non-interactive use.</para>

  <title>Mounting the New Partition</title>

  <para>Now that a file system has been created, the partition needs to
  be made accessible. In order to do this, the partition needs to be
  mounted at a chosen mount point. For the purposes of this book, it is
  assumed that the file system is mounted under the directory specified by the
  <envar>LFS</envar> environment variable as described in the previous section.
  </para>

  <para>Create the mount point and mount the LFS file system by running:</para>

<screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">mkdir -pv $LFS
mount -v -t ext4 /dev/<replaceable>&lt;xxx&gt;</replaceable> $LFS</userinput></screen>

  <para>Replace <replaceable>&lt;xxx&gt;</replaceable> with the designation of the LFS
  partition.</para>

  <para>If using multiple partitions for LFS (e.g., one for <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/</filename> and another for <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/home</filename>), mount them using:</para>

<screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">mkdir -pv $LFS
mount -v -t ext4 /dev/<replaceable>&lt;xxx&gt;</replaceable> $LFS
mkdir -v $LFS/home
mount -v -t ext4 /dev/<replaceable>&lt;yyy&gt;</replaceable> $LFS/home</userinput></screen>

  <para>Replace <replaceable>&lt;xxx&gt;</replaceable> and
  <replaceable>&lt;yyy&gt;</replaceable> with the appropriate partition
  names.</para>

  <para>Ensure that this new partition is not mounted with permissions that are
  too restrictive (such as the <option>nosuid</option> or
  <option>nodev</option> options). Run the <command moreinfo="none">mount</command> command
  without any parameters to see what options are set for the mounted LFS
  partition. If <option>nosuid</option> and/or <option>nodev</option> are set,
  the partition will need to be remounted.</para>

  <warning><para>The above instructions assume that you will not be restarting
  your computer throughout the LFS process.  If you shut down your system,
  you will either need to remount the LFS partition each time you restart 
  the build process or modify your host system's /etc/fstab file to automatically 
  remount it upon boot.  For example:

<screen role="nodump" format="linespecific">/dev/<replaceable>&lt;xxx&gt;</replaceable>  /mnt/lfs ext4   defaults      1     1</screen>

  If you use additional optional partitions, be sure to add them also.

  </para></warning>


  <para>If you are using a <systemitem class="filesystem" moreinfo="none">swap</systemitem> partition, ensure that it is enabled
  using the <command moreinfo="none">swapon</command> command:</para>

<screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">/sbin/swapon -v /dev/<replaceable>&lt;zzz&gt;</replaceable></userinput></screen>

  <para>Replace <replaceable>&lt;zzz&gt;</replaceable> with the name of the

  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This chapter includes a list of packages that need to be downloaded in
  order to build a basic Linux system. The listed version numbers correspond to
  versions of the software that are known to work, and this book is based on
  their use. We highly recommend against using newer versions because the build
  commands for one version may not work with a newer version. The newest package
  versions may also have problems that require work-arounds. These work-arounds
  will be developed and stabilized in the development version of the
  book.</para>

  <para>Download locations may not always be accessible. If a download
  location has changed since this book was published, Google (<ulink url="http://www.google.com/"/>) provides a useful search engine for
  most packages. If this search is unsuccessful, try one of the
  alternative means of downloading at <ulink url="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/mirrors.html#files"/>. </para>

  <para>Downloaded packages and patches will need to be stored somewhere
  that is conveniently available throughout the entire build. A working
  directory is also required to unpack the sources and build them.
  <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">$LFS/sources</filename> can be used both
  as the place to store the tarballs and patches and as a working
  directory. By using this directory, the required elements will be
  located on the LFS partition and will be available during all stages
  of the building process.</para>

  <para>To create this directory, execute the following command, as user
  <systemitem class="username" moreinfo="none">root</systemitem>, before starting the download
  session:</para>

<screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">mkdir -v $LFS/sources</userinput></screen>

  <para>Make this directory writable and sticky. <quote>Sticky</quote>
  means that even if multiple users have write permission on a
  directory, only the owner of a file can delete the file within a
  sticky directory. The following command will enable the write and
  sticky modes:</para>

<screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">chmod -v a+wt $LFS/sources</userinput></screen>

  <para>There are several ways to optain all the necessary packages and patches
  to build LFS:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>The files can be downloaded individually as described in the 
      next two sections.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>For stable versions of the book, a tarball of all the needed files 
      can be downloaded from one of the LFS files mirrors listed at
      <ulink url="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/mirrors.html#files"/>.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>The files can be downloaded using <command moreinfo="none">wget</command> and
      a wget-list as described below.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>To download all of the packages and patches by using
  <ulink url="../wget-list">wget-list</ulink> as an input to the
  <command moreinfo="none">wget</command> command, use:</para>

<screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">wget --input-file=wget-list --continue --directory-prefix=$LFS/sources</userinput></screen>

  <para>Additionally, starting with LFS-7.0, there is a separate file,
  <ulink url="../md5sums">md5sums</ulink>, which can be used to verify that all
  the correct packages are available before proceeding.  Place that file in
  <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">$LFS/sources</filename> and run:</para>

<screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">pushd $LFS/sources
  md5sum -c md5sums
popd</userinput></screen>

  <para>This check can be used after retrieving the needed files with any of the 
  methods listed above.</para>

        <note>
          <para>The Linux kernel is updated relatively often, many times due to
          discoveries of security vulnerabilities.  The latest available
          <!--&linux-major-version;.&linux-minor-version;.x--> stable kernel 
          version <!--should--> may be
          used, unless the errata page says otherwise.</para>

          <para>For users with limited speed or expensive bandwidth who wish to
          update the Linux kernel, a baseline version of the package and
          patches can be downloaded separately.  This may save some time or
          cost for a subsequent patch level upgrade within a minor release.

  <para>In this chapter, we will perform a few additional tasks to prepare
  for building the temporary system. We will create a set of directories in
  <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">$LFS</filename> for the installation of the
  temporary tools, add an unprivileged user to reduce risk,
  and create an appropriate build environment for that user. We will also
  explain the unit of time we use to measure how long LFS packages take to
  build, or <quote>SBUs</quote>, and give some information about package

  <title>Creating a limited directory layout in LFS filesystem</title>

  <para>The first task performed in the LFS partition is to create a limited
  directory hierarchy so that programs compiled in <xref linkend="chapter-temporary-tools"/> (as well as glibc and libstdc++ in <xref linkend="chapter-cross-tools"/>) may be installed in their final
  location. This is needed so that those temporary programs be overwritten
  when rebuilding them in <xref linkend="chapter-building-system"/>.</para>

  <para>Create the required directory layout by running the following as
  <systemitem class="username" moreinfo="none">root</systemitem>:</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">mkdir -pv $LFS/{etc,var} $LFS/usr/{bin,lib,sbin}

  <para>Programs in <xref linkend="chapter-temporary-tools"/> will be compiled

  <title>Setting Up the Environment</title>

  <para>Set up a good working environment by creating two new startup files
  for the <command moreinfo="none">bash</command> shell. While logged in as user
  <systemitem class="username" moreinfo="none">lfs</systemitem>, issue the following command
  to create a new <filename moreinfo="none">.bash_profile</filename>:</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">cat &gt; ~/.bash_profile &lt;&lt; "EOF"
<literal moreinfo="none">exec env -i HOME=$HOME TERM=$TERM PS1='\u:\w\$ ' /bin/bash</literal>
EOF</userinput></screen>

  <para>When logged on as user <systemitem class="username" moreinfo="none">lfs</systemitem>,
  the initial shell is usually a <emphasis>login</emphasis> shell which reads
  the <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/profile</filename> of the host (probably containing some
  settings and environment variables) and then <filename moreinfo="none">.bash_profile</filename>.
  The <command moreinfo="none">exec env -i.../bin/bash</command> command in the
  <filename moreinfo="none">.bash_profile</filename> file replaces the running shell with a new
  one with a completely empty environment, except for the <envar>HOME</envar>,
  <envar>TERM</envar>, and <envar>PS1</envar> variables. This ensures that no
  unwanted and potentially hazardous environment variables from the host system
  leak into the build environment. The technique used here achieves the goal of
  ensuring a clean environment.</para>

  <para>The new instance of the shell is a <emphasis>non-login</emphasis>
  shell, which does not read, and execute, the contents of <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/profile</filename> or
  <filename moreinfo="none">.bash_profile</filename> files, but rather reads, and executes, the
  <filename moreinfo="none">.bashrc</filename> file instead. Create the
  <filename moreinfo="none">.bashrc</filename> file now:</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">cat &gt; ~/.bashrc &lt;&lt; "EOF"

      <term><parameter moreinfo="none">set +h</parameter></term>
      <listitem>
  <para>The <command moreinfo="none">set +h</command> command turns off
  <command moreinfo="none">bash</command>'s hash function. Hashing is ordinarily a useful
  feature—<command moreinfo="none">bash</command> uses a hash table to remember the
  full path of executable files to avoid searching the <envar>PATH</envar>
  time and again to find the same executable. However, the new tools should
  be used as soon as they are installed. By switching off the hash function,

  <title>About SBUs</title>

  <para>Many people would like to know beforehand approximately how long
  it takes to compile and install each package. Because Linux From
  Scratch can be built on many different systems, it is impossible to
  provide accurate time estimates. The biggest package (Glibc) will
  take approximately 20 minutes on the fastest systems, but could take
  up to three days on slower systems! Instead of providing actual times,
  the Standard Build Unit (SBU) measure will be
  used instead.</para>

  <para>The SBU measure works as follows. The first package to be compiled
  from this book is binutils in <xref linkend="chapter-cross-tools"/>. The
  time it takes to compile this package is what will be referred to as the
  Standard Build Unit or SBU. All other compile times will be expressed relative
  to this time.</para>

  <para>For example, consider a package whose compilation time is 4.5
  SBUs. This means that if a system took 10 minutes to compile and
  install the first pass of binutils, it will take
  <emphasis>approximately</emphasis> 45 minutes to build this example package.
  Fortunately, most build times are shorter than the one for binutils.</para>

  <para>In general, SBUs are not entirely accurate because they depend on many
  factors, including the host system's version of GCC.  They are provided here
  to give an estimate of how long it might take to install a package, but the
  numbers can vary by as much as dozens of minutes in some cases.</para>

  <note>
    <para>For many modern systems with multiple processors (or cores) the
    compilation time for a package can be reduced by performing a "parallel
    make" by either setting an environment variable or telling the
    <command moreinfo="none">make</command> program how many processors are available.  For
    instance, an Intel i5-6500 CPU can support four simultaneous processes with:</para>

    <screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">export MAKEFLAGS='-j4'</userinput></screen>

    <para>or just building with:</para>

    <screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">make -j4</userinput></screen>

    <para>When multiple processors are used in this way, the SBU units in the
    book will vary even more than they normally would.  In some cases, the make
    step will simply fail.  Analyzing the output of the build process will also
    be more difficult because the lines of different processes will be
    interleaved.  If you run into a problem with a build step, revert back to a
    single processor build to properly analyze the error messages.</para>

  <title>About the Test Suites</title>

  <para>Most packages provide a test suite. Running the test suite for a
  newly built package is a good idea because it can provide a <quote>sanity
  check</quote> indicating that everything compiled correctly. A test suite
  that passes its set of checks usually proves that the package is
  functioning as the developer intended. It does not, however, guarantee
  that the package is totally bug free.</para>

  <para>Some test suites are more important than others. For example,
  the test suites for the core toolchain packages—GCC, binutils, and
  glibc—are of the utmost importance due to their central role in a
  properly functioning system. The test suites for GCC and glibc can
  take a very long time to complete, especially on slower hardware, but
  are strongly recommended.</para>

  <note>
    <para>Running the test suites in <xref linkend="chapter-cross-tools"/>
    and <xref linkend="chapter-temporary-tools"/>
    is impossible, since the programs are compiled with a cross-compiler,
    so are not supposed to be able to run on the build host.</para>
  </note>

  <para>A common issue with running the test suites for binutils and GCC
  is running out of pseudo terminals (PTYs). This can result in a high
  number of failing tests. This may happen for several reasons, but the
  most likely cause is that the host system does not have the
  <systemitem class="filesystem" moreinfo="none">devpts</systemitem> file system set up
  correctly. This issue is discussed in greater detail at
  <ulink url="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/faq.html#no-ptys"/>.</para>

  <para>Sometimes package test suites will fail, but for reasons which the
  developers are aware of and have deemed non-critical. Consult the logs located
  at <ulink url="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/build-logs/11.0/"/> to verify whether or not these failures are
  expected. This site is valid for all tests throughout this book.</para>

  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This part is divided into three stages: first building a cross
  compiler and its associated libraries; second, use this cross toolchain
  to build several utilities in a way that isolates them from the host
  distribution; third, enter the chroot environment, which further improves
  host isolation, and build the remaining tools needed to build the final
  system.</para>

  <important><para>With this part begins the real work of building a new
  system. It requires much care in ensuring that the instructions are
  followed exactly as the book shows them. You should try to understand
  what they do, and whatever your eagerness to finish your build, you should
  refrain from blindly type them as shown, but rather read documentation when
  there is something you do not understand. Also, keep track of your typing
  and of the output of commands, by sending them to a file, using the
  <command moreinfo="none">tee</command> utility. This allows for better diagnosing
  if something gets wrong.</para></important>

  <para>The next section gives a technical introduction to the build process,

  <title>Toolchain Technical Notes</title>

  <para>This section explains some of the rationale and technical details
  behind the overall build method. It is not essential to immediately
  understand everything in this section. Most of this information will be
  clearer after performing an actual build. This section can be referred
  to at any time during the process.</para>

  <para>The overall goal of <xref linkend="chapter-cross-tools"/> and <xref linkend="chapter-temporary-tools"/> is to produce a temporary area that
  contains a known-good set of tools that can be isolated from the host system.
  By using <command moreinfo="none">chroot</command>, the commands in the remaining chapters
  will be contained within that environment, ensuring a clean, trouble-free
  build of the target LFS system. The build process has been designed to
  minimize the risks for new readers and to provide the most educational value
  at the same time.</para>

  <para>The build process is based on the process of
  <emphasis>cross-compilation</emphasis>. Cross-compilation is normally used
  for building a compiler and its toolchain for a machine different from
  the one that is used for the build. This is not strictly needed for LFS,
  since the machine where the new system will run is the same as the one
  used for the build. But cross-compilation has the great advantage that
  anything that is cross-compiled cannot depend on the host environment.</para>

  <sect2 id="cross-compile" xreflabel="About Cross-Compilation">

    <title>About Cross-Compilation</title>

    <para>Cross-compilation involves some concepts that deserve a section on
    their own. Although this section may be omitted in a first reading, it
    is strongly suggested to come back to it later in order to get a full
    grasp of the build process.</para>

    <para>Let us first define some terms used in this context:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry><term>build</term><listitem>
        <para>is the machine where we build programs. Note that this machine
        is referred to as the <quote>host</quote> in other
        sections.</para></listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry><term>host</term><listitem>
        <para>is the machine/system where the built programs will run. Note
        that this use of <quote>host</quote> is not the same as in other
        sections.</para></listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry><term>target</term><listitem>
        <para>is only used for compilers. It is the machine the compiler
        produces code for. It may be different from both build and
        host.</para></listitem>
      </varlistentry>

    </variablelist>

    <para>As an example, let us imagine the following scenario (sometimes
    referred to as <quote>Canadian Cross</quote>): we may have a
    compiler on a slow machine only, let's call the machine A, and the compiler
    ccA. We may have also a fast machine (B), but with no compiler, and we may
    want to produce code for another slow machine (C). To build a
    compiler for machine C, we would have three stages:</para>

      </tgroup>
    </informaltable>

    <para>Then, all the other programs needed by machine C can be compiled
    using cc2 on the fast machine B. Note that unless B can run programs
    produced for C, there is no way to test the built programs until machine
    C itself is running. For example, for testing ccC, we may want to add a
    fourth stage:</para>

    </informaltable>

    <para>In the example above, only cc1 and cc2 are cross-compilers, that is,
    they produce code for a machine different from the one they are run on.
    The other compilers ccA and ccC produce code for the machine they are run
    on. Such compilers are called <emphasis>native</emphasis> compilers.</para>

  <sect2 id="lfs-cross">
    <title>Implementation of Cross-Compilation for LFS</title>

    <note>
      <para>Almost all the build systems use names of the form
      cpu-vendor-kernel-os referred to as the machine triplet. An astute
      reader may wonder why a <quote>triplet</quote> refers to a four component
      name. The reason is history: initially, three component names were enough
      to designate unambiguously a machine, but with new machines and systems
      appearing, that proved insufficient. The word <quote>triplet</quote>
      remained. A simple way to determine your machine triplet is to run
      the <command moreinfo="none">config.guess</command>
      script that comes with the source for many packages. Unpack the binutils
      sources and run the script: <userinput moreinfo="none">./config.guess</userinput> and note
      the output. For example, for a 32-bit Intel processor the
      output will be <emphasis>i686-pc-linux-gnu</emphasis>. On a 64-bit
      system it will be <emphasis>x86_64-pc-linux-gnu</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>Also be aware of the name of the platform's dynamic linker, often
      referred to as the dynamic loader (not to be confused with the standard
      linker <command moreinfo="none">ld</command> that is part of binutils). The dynamic linker
      provided by Glibc finds and loads the shared libraries needed by a
      program, prepares the program to run, and then runs it. The name of the
      dynamic linker for a 32-bit Intel machine will be <filename class="libraryfile" moreinfo="none">ld-linux.so.2</filename> (<filename class="libraryfile" moreinfo="none">ld-linux-x86-64.so.2</filename> for 64-bit systems). A
      sure-fire way to determine the name of the dynamic linker is to inspect a
      random binary from the host system by running: <userinput moreinfo="none">readelf -l
      &lt;name of binary&gt; | grep interpreter</userinput> and noting the
      output. The authoritative reference covering all platforms is in the
      <filename moreinfo="none">shlib-versions</filename> file in the root of the Glibc source
      tree.</para>
    </note>

    <para>In order to fake a cross compilation, the name of the host triplet
    is slightly adjusted by changing the "vendor" field in the
    <envar>LFS_TGT</envar> variable. We also use the
    <parameter moreinfo="none">--with-sysroot</parameter> option when building the cross linker and
    cross compiler to tell them where to find the needed host files. This
    ensures that none of the other programs built in <xref linkend="chapter-temporary-tools"/> can link to libraries on the build
    machine. Only two stages are mandatory, and one more for tests:</para>

    </informaltable>

    <para>In the above table, <quote>on pc</quote> means the commands are run
    on a machine using the already installed distribution. <quote>On
    lfs</quote> means the commands are run in a chrooted environment.</para>

    <para>Now, there is more about cross-compiling: the C language is not
    just a compiler, but also defines a standard library. In this book, the
    GNU C library, named glibc, is used. This library must
    be compiled for the lfs machine, that is, using the cross compiler cc1. 
    But the compiler itself uses an internal library implementing complex
    instructions not available in the assembler instruction set. This
    internal library is named libgcc, and must be linked to the glibc
    library to be fully functional! Furthermore, the standard library for
    C++ (libstdc++) also needs being linked to glibc. The solution to this
    chicken and egg problem is to first build a degraded cc1 based libgcc,
    lacking some functionalities such as threads and exception handling, then
    build glibc using this degraded compiler (glibc itself is not
    degraded), then build libstdc++. But this last library will lack the
    same functionalities as libgcc.</para>

    <para>This is not the end of the story: the conclusion of the preceding
    paragraph is that cc1 is unable to build a fully functional libstdc++, but
    this is the only compiler available for building the C/C++ libraries
    during stage 2! Of course, the compiler built during stage 2, cc-lfs,
    would be able to build those libraries, but (1) the build system of
    GCC does not know that it is usable on pc, and (2) using it on pc
    would be at risk of linking to the pc libraries, since cc-lfs is a native
    compiler. So we have to build libstdc++ later, in chroot.</para>

    <para>The cross-compiler will be installed in a separate <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">$LFS/tools</filename> directory, since it will not
    be part of the final system.</para>

    <para>Binutils is installed first because the <command moreinfo="none">configure</command>
    runs of both GCC and Glibc perform various feature tests on the assembler
    and linker to determine which software features to enable or disable. This
    is more important than one might first realize. An incorrectly configured
    GCC or Glibc can result in a subtly broken toolchain, where the impact of
    such breakage might not show up until near the end of the build of an
    entire distribution. A test suite failure will usually highlight this error
    before too much additional work is performed.</para>

    <para>Binutils installs its assembler and linker in two locations,
    <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">$LFS/tools/bin</filename> and <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">$LFS/tools/$LFS_TGT/bin</filename>. The tools in one
    location are hard linked to the other. An important facet of the linker is
    its library search order. Detailed information can be obtained from
    <command moreinfo="none">ld</command> by passing it the <parameter moreinfo="none">--verbose</parameter>
    flag. For example, <command moreinfo="none">$LFS_TGT-ld --verbose | grep SEARCH</command>
    will illustrate the current search paths and their order. It shows which
    files are linked by <command moreinfo="none">ld</command> by compiling a dummy program and
    passing the <parameter moreinfo="none">--verbose</parameter> switch to the linker. For
    example,
    <command moreinfo="none">$LFS_TGT-gcc dummy.c -Wl,--verbose 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep succeeded</command>
    will show all the files successfully opened during the linking.</para>

    <para>The next package installed is GCC. An example of what can be
    seen during its run of <command moreinfo="none">configure</command> is:</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><computeroutput moreinfo="none">checking what assembler to use... /mnt/lfs/tools/i686-lfs-linux-gnu/bin/as
checking what linker to use... /mnt/lfs/tools/i686-lfs-linux-gnu/bin/ld</computeroutput></screen>

    <para>This is important for the reasons mentioned above. It also
    demonstrates that GCC's configure script does not search the PATH
    directories to find which tools to use. However, during the actual
    operation of <command moreinfo="none">gcc</command> itself, the same search paths are not
    necessarily used. To find out which standard linker <command moreinfo="none">gcc</command>
    will use, run: <command moreinfo="none">$LFS_TGT-gcc -print-prog-name=ld</command>.</para>

    <para>Detailed information can be obtained from <command moreinfo="none">gcc</command> by
    passing it the <parameter moreinfo="none">-v</parameter> command line option while compiling
    a dummy program. For example, <command moreinfo="none">gcc -v dummy.c</command> will show
    detailed information about the preprocessor, compilation, and assembly
    stages, including <command moreinfo="none">gcc</command>'s included search paths and their
    order.</para>

    <para>Next installed are sanitized Linux API headers. These allow the
    standard C library (Glibc) to interface with features that the Linux
    kernel will provide.</para>

    <para>The next package installed is Glibc. The most important
    considerations for building Glibc are the compiler, binary tools, and
    kernel headers. The compiler is generally not an issue since Glibc will
    always use the compiler relating to the <parameter moreinfo="none">--host</parameter>
    parameter passed to its configure script; e.g. in our case, the compiler
    will be <command moreinfo="none">$LFS_TGT-gcc</command>. The binary tools and kernel
    headers can be a bit more complicated. Therefore, take no risks and use
    the available configure switches to enforce the correct selections. After
    the run of <command moreinfo="none">configure</command>, check the contents of the
    <filename moreinfo="none">config.make</filename> file in the <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">build</filename> directory for all important details.
    Note the use of <parameter moreinfo="none">CC="$LFS_TGT-gcc"</parameter> (with
    <envar>$LFS_TGT</envar> expanded) to control which binary tools are used
    and the use of the <parameter moreinfo="none">-nostdinc</parameter> and
    <parameter moreinfo="none">-isystem</parameter> flags to control the compiler's include
    search path. These items highlight an important aspect of the Glibc
    package—it is very self-sufficient in terms of its build machinery
    and generally does not rely on toolchain defaults.</para>

    <para>As said above, the standard C++ library is compiled next, followed in
    <xref linkend="chapter-temporary-tools"/> by all the programs that need
    themselves to be built. The install step of all those packages uses the
    <envar>DESTDIR</envar> variable to have the
    programs land into the LFS filesystem.</para>

    <para>At the end of <xref linkend="chapter-temporary-tools"/> the native
    lfs compiler is installed. First binutils-pass2 is built,
    with the same <envar>DESTDIR</envar> install as the other programs,
    then the second pass of GCC is constructed, omitting libstdc++
    and other non-important libraries.  Due to some weird logic in GCC's
    configure script, <envar>CC_FOR_TARGET</envar> ends up as
    <command moreinfo="none">cc</command> when the host is the same as the target, but is
    different from the build system. This is why
    <parameter moreinfo="none">CC_FOR_TARGET=$LFS_TGT-gcc</parameter> is put explicitly into
    the configure options.</para>

    <para>Upon entering the chroot environment in <xref linkend="chapter-chroot-temporary-tools"/>, the first task is to install
    libstdc++. Then temporary installations of programs needed for the proper
    operation of the toolchain are performed. From this point onwards, the
    core toolchain is self-contained and self-hosted.  In 
    <xref linkend="chapter-building-system"/>, final versions of all the
    packages needed for a fully functional system are built, tested and
    installed.</para>

  <title>General Compilation Instructions</title>

  <para>When building packages there are several assumptions made within
  the instructions:</para>

  <itemizedlist>

  <listitem>
    <para>Several of the packages are patched before compilation, but only when
    the patch is needed to circumvent a problem. A patch is often needed in
    both this and the following chapters, but sometimes in only one location.
    Therefore, do not be concerned if instructions for a downloaded patch seem
    to be missing.  Warning messages about <emphasis>offset</emphasis> or
    <emphasis>fuzz</emphasis> may also be encountered when applying a patch. Do
    not worry about these warnings, as the patch was still successfully
    applied.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>During the compilation of most packages, there will be several
    warnings that scroll by on the screen. These are normal and can safely be
    ignored.  These warnings are as they appear—warnings about
    deprecated, but not invalid, use of the C or C++ syntax. C standards change
    fairly often, and some packages still use the older standard. This is not a
    problem, but does prompt the warning.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Check one last time that the <envar>LFS</envar> environment variable
    is set up properly:</para>

<screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">echo $LFS</userinput></screen>

    <para>Make sure the output shows the path to the LFS partition's mount
    point, which is <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/mnt/lfs</filename>, using our
    example.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>

    <para>Finally, two important items must be emphasized:</para>

    <important>

      <para>The build instructions assume that the <xref linkend="ch-partitioning-hostreqs"/>, including symbolic links, have
      been set properly:</para>

    <para>It is important that Binutils be the first package compiled

    <para>This build of GCC has installed a couple of internal system

    include the corresponding system <filename moreinfo="none">limits.h</filename> header, in

    time of this build of GCC <filename moreinfo="none">$LFS/usr/include/limits.h</filename>
    does not exist, so the internal header that has just been installed is a
    partial, self-contained file and does not include the extended features of
    the system header. This is adequate for building glibc, but the full
    internal header will be needed later.  Create a full version of the internal
    header using a command that is identical to what the GCC build system does
    in normal circumstances:</para>

  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This chapter shows how to cross-compile basic utilities using
  the just built cross-toolchain. Those utilities are installed into
  their final location, but cannot be used yet. Basic tasks still rely on
  the host's tools. Nevertheless, the installed libraries are used when
  linking.</para>

  <para>Using the utilities will be possible in next chapter after entering
  the <quote>chroot</quote> environment. But all the packages built in the
  present chapter need to be built before we do that. Therefore we cannot be 
  independent of the host system yet.</para>

  <para>Once again, let us recall that improper setting of <envar>LFS</envar>
  together with building as <systemitem class="username" moreinfo="none">root</systemitem>,
  may render your computer unusable.
  This whole chapter must be done as user <systemitem class="username" moreinfo="none">lfs</systemitem>, with the environment as described in
  <xref linkend="ch-preps-settingenviron"/>.</para>

  <title>Entering Chroot and Building Additional Temporary Tools</title>

  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This chapter shows how to build the last missing bits of the temporary
  system: the tools needed by the build machinery of various packages.
  Now that all circular dependencies
  have been resolved, we can use a <quote>chroot</quote> environment,
  completely isolated the host operating system used for the build, except
  for the running kernel.</para>

  <para>For proper operation of the isolated environment, some communication
  with the running kernel must be established. This is done through the
  so-called <emphasis>Virtual Kernel File Systems</emphasis>, which must be
  mounted when entering the chroot environment. You may want to check
  that they are mounted by issuing <command moreinfo="none">findmnt</command>.</para>

  <para>Until <xref linkend="ch-tools-chroot"/>, the commands must be
  run as <systemitem class="username" moreinfo="none">root</systemitem>, with the
  <envar>LFS</envar> variable set. After entering chroot, all commands
  are run as root, fortunately without access to the OS of the computer
  you built LFS on. Be careful anyway, as it is easy to destroy the whole
  LFS system with badly formed commands.</para>

  <title>Changing Ownership</title>

  <note>
    <para>The commands in the remainder of this book must be performed while
    logged in as user <systemitem class="username" moreinfo="none">root</systemitem> and no
    longer as user <systemitem class="username" moreinfo="none">lfs</systemitem>. Also, double
    check that <envar>$LFS</envar> is set in <systemitem class="username" moreinfo="none">root</systemitem>'s environment.</para>
  </note>

  <para>Currently, the whole directory hierarchy in <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">$LFS</filename>
  is owned by the user <systemitem class="username" moreinfo="none">lfs</systemitem>, a user
  that exists only on the host system. If the directories and files under <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">$LFS</filename> are kept as they are, they will be
  owned by a user ID without a corresponding account. This is dangerous because
  a user account created later could get this same user ID and would own all
  the files under <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">$LFS</filename>, thus exposing
  these files to possible malicious manipulation.</para>

  <para>To address this issue, change the
  ownership of the <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">$LFS/*</filename> directories to
  user <systemitem class="username" moreinfo="none">root</systemitem> by running the following
  command:</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">chown -R root:root $LFS/{usr,lib,var,etc,bin,sbin,tools}

    <title>Creating Initial Device Nodes</title>

    <para>When the kernel boots the system, it requires the presence of a few
    device nodes, in particular the <filename class="devicefile" moreinfo="none">console</filename> and <filename class="devicefile" moreinfo="none">null</filename> devices. The device nodes must be
    created on the hard disk so that they are available before the kernel
    populates <systemitem class="filesystem" moreinfo="none">/dev</systemitem>), and
    additionally when Linux is started with
    <parameter moreinfo="none">init=/bin/bash</parameter>. Create the devices by running the
    following commands:</para>

  <sect2 id="ch-tools-bindmount">
    <title>Mounting and Populating /dev</title>

      <para>The recommended method of populating the <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/dev</filename> directory with devices is to mount a
      virtual filesystem (such as <systemitem class="filesystem" moreinfo="none">tmpfs</systemitem>) on the <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/dev</filename> directory, and allow the devices to be
      created dynamically on that virtual filesystem as they are detected or
      accessed. Device creation is generally done during the boot process
      by Udev. Since this new system does not yet have Udev and has not yet
      been booted, it is necessary to mount and populate <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/dev</filename> manually. This is accomplished by bind
      mounting the host system's <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/dev</filename>
      directory. A bind mount is a special type of mount that allows you to
      create a mirror of a directory or mount point to some other location. Use
      the following command to achieve this:</para>

  <title>Entering the Chroot Environment</title>

  <para>Now that all the packages which are required to build the rest of the
  needed tools are on the system, it is time to enter the chroot environment to
  finish installing the remaining temporary tools. This environment will be in
  use also for installing the final system. As user <systemitem class="username" moreinfo="none">root</systemitem>, run the following command to enter the
  environment that is, at the moment, populated with only the temporary
  tools:</para>

<screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">chroot "$LFS" /usr/bin/env -i   \
    HOME=/root                  \
    TERM="$TERM"                \
    PS1='(lfs chroot) \u:\w\$ ' \
    PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/sbin     \
    /bin/bash --login +h</userinput></screen>

  <para>The <parameter moreinfo="none">-i</parameter> option given to the <command moreinfo="none">env</command>
  command will clear all variables of the chroot environment. After that, only
  the <envar>HOME</envar>, <envar>TERM</envar>, <envar>PS1</envar>, and
  <envar>PATH</envar> variables are set again. The
  <parameter moreinfo="none">TERM=$TERM</parameter> construct will set the <envar>TERM</envar>
  variable inside chroot to the same value as outside chroot. This variable is
  needed for programs like <command moreinfo="none">vim</command> and <command moreinfo="none">less</command>
  to operate properly.  If other variables are desired, such as
  <envar>CFLAGS</envar> or <envar>CXXFLAGS</envar>, this is a good place to set
  them again.</para>

  <para>From this point on, there is no need to use the
  <envar>LFS</envar> variable anymore because all work will be restricted
  to the LFS file system.  This is because the Bash shell is told that
  <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">$LFS</filename> is now the root
  (<filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/</filename>) directory.</para>

  <para>Notice that <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/tools/bin</filename> is not
  in the <envar>PATH</envar>. This means that the cross toolchain will no longer be
  used in the chroot environment. This occurs when the shell does not
  <quote>remember</quote> the locations of executed binaries—for this
  reason, hashing is switched off by passing the <parameter moreinfo="none">+h</parameter> option
  to <command moreinfo="none">bash</command>.</para>

  <para>Note that the <command moreinfo="none">bash</command> prompt will say
  <computeroutput moreinfo="none">I have no name!</computeroutput> This is normal because the
  <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/passwd</filename> file has not been created yet.</para>

  <note>
    <para>It is important that all the commands throughout the remainder of this
    chapter and the following chapters are run from within the chroot
    environment. If you leave this environment for any reason (rebooting for
    example), ensure that the virtual kernel filesystems are mounted as
    explained in <xref linkend="ch-tools-bindmount"/> and <xref linkend="ch-tools-kernfsmount"/> and enter chroot again before continuing

<screen format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">mkdir -pv /{boot,home,mnt,opt,srv}</userinput></screen>

  <para>Directories are, by default, created with permission mode 755, but
  this is not desirable for all directories. In the commands above, two
  changes are made—one to the home directory of user <systemitem class="username" moreinfo="none">root</systemitem>, and another to the directories for
  temporary files.</para>

  <para>The first mode change ensures that not just anybody can enter
  the <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/root</filename> directory—the
  same as a normal user would do with his or her home directory. The
  second mode change makes sure that any user can write to the
  <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/tmp</filename> and <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/var/tmp</filename> directories, but cannot remove
  another user's files from them. The latter is prohibited by the so-called

  <para>The created groups are not part of any standard—they are groups
  decided on in part by the requirements of the Udev configuration in Chapter
  9, and in part by common convention employed by a number of existing Linux
  distributions. In addition, some test suites rely on specific users or
  groups.  The Linux Standard Base (LSB, available at <ulink url="http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/lsb.shtml"/>) only recommends that,
  besides the group <systemitem class="groupname" moreinfo="none">root</systemitem> with a
  Group ID (GID) of 0, a group <systemitem class="groupname" moreinfo="none">bin</systemitem>
  with a GID of 1 be present. All other group names and GIDs can be chosen
  freely by the system administrator since well-written programs do not depend
  on GID numbers, but rather use the group's name.</para>

  <para>Some tests in <xref linkend="chapter-building-system"/> need a regular

  <para>Note the use of the <parameter moreinfo="none">+h</parameter> directive. This tells

  <para>The <command moreinfo="none">login</command>, <command moreinfo="none">agetty</command>, and
  <command moreinfo="none">init</command> programs (and others) use a number of log
  files to record information such as who was logged into the system and
  when. However, these programs will not write to the log files if they
  do not already exist. Initialize the log files and give them
  proper permissions:</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">touch /var/log/{btmp,lastlog,faillog,wtmp}

  <para>The <filename moreinfo="none">/var/log/wtmp</filename> file records all logins and
  logouts. The <filename moreinfo="none">/var/log/lastlog</filename> file records when each
  user last logged in. The <filename moreinfo="none">/var/log/faillog</filename> file records
  failed login attempts.  The <filename moreinfo="none">/var/log/btmp</filename> file records
  the bad login attempts.</para>

    <title>Backup</title>

    <note><para>
      All the remaining steps in this section are optional. Nevertheless,
      as soon as you begin installing packages in <xref linkend="chapter-building-system"/>, the temporary files will be
      overwritten. So it may be a good idea to do a backup of the current
      system as described below. 
    </para></note>
  
    <para>
      The following steps are performed from outside the chroot
      environment. That means, you have to leave the chroot environment
      first before continuing. The reason for that is to
      get access to file system locations outside of the chroot
      environment to store/read the backup archive which should
      not be placed within the
      <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">$LFS</filename> hierarchy for
      safety reasons.
    </para>

    <important>
      <para>All of the following instructions are executed by
        <systemitem class="username" moreinfo="none">root</systemitem>. Take extra
        care about the commands you're going to run as mistakes
        here can modify your host system. Be aware that the
        environment variable <envar>LFS</envar> 
        is set for user <systemitem class="username" moreinfo="none">lfs</systemitem> by default 
        but may <emphasis>not</emphasis> be set for 
        <systemitem class="username" moreinfo="none">root</systemitem>. Whenever 
        commands are to be executed by <systemitem class="username" moreinfo="none">root</systemitem>, 
        make sure you have set <envar>LFS</envar>.
        This has been discussed in <xref linkend="ch-partitioning-aboutlfs"/>.
      </para>
    </important>

    <para>
       Now, if you are making a backup, leave the chroot environment:
    </para>

<screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">exit</userinput></screen>

    <para>
      At this point the essential programs and libraries have been created
      and your current system is in a good state. Your system can now be
      backed up for later reuse. In case of fatal failures in the subsequent
      chapters, it often turns out that removing everything and starting over
      (more carefully) is the best option to recover. Unfortunately, all the
      temporary files will be removed, too. To avoid spending extra time to
      redo something which has been built successfully, prepare a backup.
    </para>

    <para>
      Make sure you have at least 1 GB free disk space (the source tarballs
      will be included in the backup archive) in the home directory of user 
      <systemitem class="username" moreinfo="none">root</systemitem>.
    </para>

    <para>Before we make a backup, unmount the virtual file systems:</para>

<screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">umount $LFS/dev{/pts,}
umount $LFS/{sys,proc,run}</userinput></screen>

    <para>
      Create the backup archive by running the following command:
    </para>

    <note>
       <para>
          Because the backup archive is compressed, it takes a relatively
          long time (over 10 minutes) even on a resonably fast system.
       </para>
       
       <para>
          Also, ensure the <envar>LFS</envar> environment variable is set 
          for the root user.

    <title>Restore</title>

    <para>
      In case some mistakes have been made and you need to start over, you can
      use this backup to restore the system and save some recovery time.
      Since the sources are located under 
      <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">$LFS</filename>, they are included in the
      backup archive as well, so they do not need to be downloaded again. After
      checking that <envar>$LFS</envar> is set properly,
      restore the backup by executing the following commands:

<!-- Make the following look different so users don't blindly run the

    <warning><para>The following commands are extremly dangerous.  If
    you run <command moreinfo="none">rm -rf ./*</command> as the root user and you 
    do not change to the $LFS directory or the <envar>LFS</envar> 
    environment variable is not set for the root user, it will destroy 
    your entire host system.  YOU ARE WARNED.</para></warning>

       Again, double check that the environment has been setup properly
       and continue building the rest of the system.

    <important>
      <para>
         If you left the chroot environment to create a backup or restart
         building using a restore, remember to check that the virtual
         filesystems are still mounted (<command moreinfo="none">findmnt | grep
         $LFS</command>).  If they are not mounted, remount them now as
         described in <xref linkend="ch-tools-kernfs"/> and re-enter the chroot
         environment (see <xref linkend="ch-tools-chroot"/>) before continuing.

  <title>Installing Basic System Software</title>

  <sect1 id="ch-system-introduction">
  <?dbhtml filename="introduction.html"?>

  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>In this chapter, we start constructing the LFS system in earnest.
  </para>

  <para>The installation of this software is straightforward. Although in many
  cases the installation instructions could be made shorter and more generic,
  we have opted to provide the full instructions for every package to minimize
  the possibilities for mistakes.  The key to learning what makes a Linux system
  work is to know what each package is used for and why you (or the system)
  may need it.</para>

  <para>We do not recommend using optimizations.  They can make
  a program run slightly faster, but they may also cause compilation
  difficulties and problems when running the program.  If a package refuses to
  compile when using optimization, try to compile it without optimization and
  see if that fixes the problem. Even if the package does compile when using
  optimization, there is the risk it may have been compiled incorrectly because
  of the complex interactions between the code and build tools.  Also note that
  the <option>-march</option> and <option>-mtune</option> options using values
  not specified in the book have not been tested. This may cause problems with
  the toolchain packages (Binutils, GCC and Glibc).  The small potential gains
  achieved in using compiler optimizations are often outweighed by the risks.
  First-time builders of LFS are encouraged to build without custom
  optimizations. The subsequent system will still run very fast and be stable
  at the same time.</para>

  <para>Before the installation instructions, each installation page provides
  information about the package, including a concise description of what it
  contains, approximately how long it will take to build, and how much disk
  space is required during this building process. Following the installation
  instructions, there is a list of programs and libraries (along with brief
  descriptions) that the package installs.</para>

  <note><para>The SBU values and required disk space includes test suite data
  for all applicable packages in <xref linkend="chapter-building-system"/>. SBU
  values have been calculated using a single CPU core (-j1) for all
  operations.</para></note>

  <sect2>
    <title>About libraries</title>

    <para>In general, the LFS editors discourage building and installing static
    libraries.  The original purpose for most static libraries has been made
    obsolete in a modern Linux system.  In addition, linking a static library
    into a program can be detrimental.  If an update to the library is needed
    to remove a security problem, all programs that use the static library will
    need to be relinked to the new library.  Since the use of static libraries
    is not always obvious, the relevant programs (and the procedures needed to
    do the linking) may not even be known.</para>

    <para>In the procedures in this chapter, we remove or disable installation of
    most static libraries. Usually this is done by passing a
    <option>--disable-static</option> option to <command moreinfo="none">configure</command>.
    In other cases, alternate means are needed. In a few cases, especially
    glibc and gcc, the use of static libraries remains essential to the general
    package building process. </para>

  <title>Package Management</title>

  <para>Package Management is an often requested addition to the LFS Book. A
  Package Manager allows tracking the installation of files making it easy to
  remove and upgrade packages. As well as the binary and library files, a
  package manager will handle the installation of configuration files.  Before
  you begin to wonder, NO—this section will not talk about nor recommend
  any particular package manager. What it provides is a roundup of the more
  popular techniques and how they work. The perfect package manager for you may
  be among these techniques or may be a combination of two or more of these
  techniques. This section briefly mentions issues that may arise when upgrading
  packages.</para>

  <para>Some reasons why no package manager is mentioned in LFS or BLFS
  include:</para>

    <title>Upgrade Issues</title>

    <para>A Package Manager makes it easy to upgrade to newer versions when they
    are released. Generally the instructions in the LFS and BLFS books can be
    used to upgrade to the newer versions. Here are some points that you should
    be aware of when upgrading packages, especially on a running system.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>If Linux kernel needs to be upgraded (for example, from
        5.10.17 to 5.10.18 or 5.11.1), nothing else need to be rebuilt.
        The system will keep working fine thanks to the well-defined border
        between kernel and userspace.  Specifically, Linux API headers
        need not to be (and should not be, see the next item) upgraded
        alongside the kernel.  You'll need to reboot your system to use the
        upgraded kernel.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>If Linux API headers or Glibc needs to be upgraded to a newer
        version, (e.g.  from glibc-2.31 to glibc-2.32), it is safer to
        rebuild LFS.  Though you <emphasis>may</emphasis> be able to rebuild
        all the packages in their dependency order, we do not recommend
        it.  </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem> <para>If a package containing a shared library is updated, and
      if the name of the library changes, then any packages dynamically
      linked to the library need to be recompiled in order to link against the
      newer library.  (Note that there is no correlation between the package
      version and the name of the library.) For example, consider a package
      foo-1.2.3 that installs a shared library with name <filename class="libraryfile" moreinfo="none">libfoo.so.1</filename>. If you upgrade the package to
      a newer version foo-1.2.4 that installs a shared library with name
      <filename class="libraryfile" moreinfo="none">libfoo.so.2</filename>. In this case, any
      packages that are dynamically linked to <filename class="libraryfile" moreinfo="none">libfoo.so.1</filename> need to be recompiled to link
      against <filename class="libraryfile" moreinfo="none">libfoo.so.2</filename> in order to
      use the new library version. You should not remove the previous
      libraries unless all the dependent packages are recompiled.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem> <para>If a package containing a shared library is updated,
      and the name of library doesn't change, but the version number of the
      library <emphasis role="bold">file</emphasis> decreases (for example,
      the name of the library is kept named
      <filename class="libraryfile" moreinfo="none">libfoo.so.1</filename>,
      but the name of library file is changed from
      <filename class="libraryfile" moreinfo="none">libfoo.so.1.25</filename> to
      <filename class="libraryfile" moreinfo="none">libfoo.so.1.24</filename>),
      you should remove the library file from the previously installed version
      (<filename class="libraryfile" moreinfo="none">libfoo.so.1.25</filename> in the case).
      Or, a <command moreinfo="none">ldconfig</command> run (by yourself using a command
      line, or by the installation of some package) will reset the symlink
      <filename class="libraryfile" moreinfo="none">libfoo.so.1</filename> to point to
      the old library file because it seems having a <quote>newer</quote>
      version, as its version number is larger.  This situation may happen if
      you have to downgrade a package, or the package changes the versioning
      scheme of library files suddenly.</para> </listitem>

      <listitem> <para>If a package containing a shared library is updated,
      and the name of library doesn't change, but a severe issue
      (especially, a security vulnerability) is fixed, all running programs
      linked to the shared library should be restarted.  The following
      command, run as <systemitem class="username" moreinfo="none">root</systemitem> after
      updating, will list what is using the old versions of those libraries
      (replace <replaceable>libfoo</replaceable> with the name of the
      library):</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><userinput role="nodump" moreinfo="none">grep -l  -e '<replaceable>libfoo</replaceable>.*deleted' /proc/*/maps |
   tr -cd 0-9\\n | xargs -r ps u</userinput></screen>

      <para>
        If <application moreinfo="none">OpenSSH</application> is being used for accessing
        the system and it is linked to the updated library, you need to
        restart <command moreinfo="none">sshd</command> service, then logout, login again,
        and rerun that command to confirm nothing is still using the
        deleted libraries.
      </para></listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>If a binary or a shared library is overwritten, the processes
        using the code or data in the binary or library may crash.  The
        correct way to update a binary or a shared library without causing
        the process to crash is to remove it first, then install the new
        version into position. The <command moreinfo="none">install</command> command
        provided by <application moreinfo="none">Coreutils</application> has already
        implemented this and most packages use it to install binaries and
        libraries.  This means that you won't be troubled by this issue most of the time.
        However, the install process of some packages (notably Mozilla JS
        in BLFS) just overwrites the file if it exists and causes a crash, so
        it's safer to save your work and close unneeded running processes
        before updating a package.</para>

    <title>Package Management Techniques</title>

    <para>The following are some common package management techniques. Before
    making a decision on a package manager, do some research on the various
    techniques, particularly the drawbacks of the particular scheme.</para>

    <sect3>
      <title>It is All in My Head!</title>

      <para>Yes, this is a package management technique. Some folks do not find
      the need for a package manager because they know the packages intimately
      and know what files are installed by each package. Some users also do not
      need any package management because they plan on rebuilding the entire
      system when a package is changed.</para>

    </sect3>

    <sect3>
      <title>Install in Separate Directories</title>

      <para>This is a simplistic package management that does not need any extra
      package to manage the installations. Each package is installed in a
      separate directory. For example, package foo-1.1 is installed in
      <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/usr/pkg/foo-1.1</filename>
      and a symlink is made from <filename moreinfo="none">/usr/pkg/foo</filename> to
      <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/usr/pkg/foo-1.1</filename>. When installing
      a new version foo-1.2, it is installed in
      <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/usr/pkg/foo-1.2</filename> and the previous
      symlink is replaced by a symlink to the new version.</para>

      <para>Environment variables such as <envar>PATH</envar>,
      <envar>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</envar>, <envar>MANPATH</envar>,
      <envar>INFOPATH</envar> and <envar>CPPFLAGS</envar> need to be expanded to
      include <filename moreinfo="none">/usr/pkg/foo</filename>. For more than a few packages,
      this scheme becomes unmanageable.</para>

    </sect3>

    <sect3>
      <title>Symlink Style Package Management</title>

      <para>This is a variation of the previous package management technique.
      Each package is installed similar to the previous scheme. But instead of
      making the symlink, each file is symlinked into the
      <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/usr</filename> hierarchy. This removes the
      need to expand the environment variables. Though the symlinks can be
      created by the user to automate the creation, many package managers have
      been written using this approach. A few of the popular ones include Stow,
      Epkg, Graft, and Depot.</para>

      <para>The installation needs to be faked, so that the package thinks that
      it is installed in <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/usr</filename> though in
      reality it is installed in the
      <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/usr/pkg</filename> hierarchy. Installing in
      this manner is not usually a trivial task. For example, consider that you
      are installing a package libfoo-1.1. The following instructions may
      not install the package properly:</para>

<screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">./configure --prefix=/usr/pkg/libfoo/1.1
make
make install</userinput></screen>

      <para>The installation will work, but the dependent packages may not link
      to libfoo as you would expect. If you compile a package that links against
      libfoo, you may notice that it is linked to
      <filename class="libraryfile" moreinfo="none">/usr/pkg/libfoo/1.1/lib/libfoo.so.1</filename>
      instead of <filename class="libraryfile" moreinfo="none">/usr/lib/libfoo.so.1</filename>
      as you would expect. The correct approach is to use the
      <envar>DESTDIR</envar> strategy to fake installation of the package. This
      approach works as follows:</para>

<screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">./configure --prefix=/usr
make
make DESTDIR=/usr/pkg/libfoo/1.1 install</userinput></screen>

      <para>Most packages support this approach, but there are some which do not.
      For the non-compliant packages, you may either need to manually install the
      package, or you may find that it is easier to install some problematic
      packages into <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/opt</filename>.</para>

    <sect3>
      <title>Timestamp Based</title>

      <para>In this technique, a file is timestamped before the installation of
      the package. After the installation, a simple use of the
      <command moreinfo="none">find</command> command with the appropriate options can generate
      a log of all the files installed after the timestamp file was created. A
      package manager written with this approach is install-log.</para>

      <para>Though this scheme has the advantage of being simple, it has two
      drawbacks. If, during installation, the files are installed with any
      timestamp other than the current time, those files will not be tracked by
      the package manager. Also, this scheme can only be used when one package
      is installed at a time. The logs are not reliable if two packages are
      being installed on two different consoles.</para>

    <sect3>
      <title>Tracing Installation Scripts</title>

      <para>In this approach, the commands that the installation scripts perform
      are recorded.  There are two techniques that one can use:</para>

      <para>The <envar>LD_PRELOAD</envar> environment variable can be set to
      point to a library to be preloaded before installation.  During
      installation, this library tracks the packages that are being installed by
      attaching itself to various executables such as <command moreinfo="none">cp</command>,
      <command moreinfo="none">install</command>, <command moreinfo="none">mv</command> and tracking the system
      calls that modify the filesystem. For this approach to work, all the
      executables need to be dynamically linked without the suid or sgid bit.
      Preloading the library may cause some unwanted side-effects during
      installation. Therefore, it is advised that one performs some tests to
      ensure that the package manager does not break anything and logs all the
      appropriate files.</para>

      <para>The second technique is to use <command moreinfo="none">strace</command>, which
      logs all system calls made during the execution of the installation
      scripts.</para>
    </sect3>

    <sect3>
      <title>Creating Package Archives</title>

      <para>In this scheme, the package installation is faked into a separate
      tree as described in the Symlink style package management. After the
      installation, a package archive is created using the installed files.
      This archive is then used to install the package either on the local
      machine or can even be used to install the package on other machines.</para>

      <para>This approach is used by most of the package managers found in the
      commercial distributions. Examples of package managers that follow this
      approach are RPM (which, incidentally, is required by the <ulink url="http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/lsb.shtml">Linux
      Standard Base Specification</ulink>), pkg-utils, Debian's apt, and
      Gentoo's Portage system.  A hint describing how to adopt this style of
      package management for LFS systems is located at <ulink url="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/fakeroot.txt"/>.</para>

      <para>Creation of package files that include dependency information is
      complex and is beyond the scope of LFS.</para>

      <para>Slackware uses a <command moreinfo="none">tar</command> based system for package
      archives.  This system purposely does not handle package dependencies
      as more complex package managers do.  For details of Slackware package
      management, see <ulink url="http://www.slackbook.org/html/package-management.html"/>.</para>
    </sect3>

      <title>User Based Management</title>

      <para>This scheme, unique to LFS, was devised by Matthias Benkmann, and is
      available from the <ulink url="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/">Hints Project</ulink>. In
      this scheme, each package is installed as a separate user into the
      standard locations. Files belonging to a package are easily identified by
      checking the user ID. The features and shortcomings of this approach are
      too complex to describe in this section. For the details please see the
      hint at <ulink url="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/more_control_and_pkg_man.txt"/>.</para>

    <title>Deploying LFS on Multiple Systems</title>

    <para>One of the advantages of an LFS system is that there are no files that
    depend on the position of files on a disk system.  Cloning an LFS build to
    another computer with the same architecture as the base system is as
    simple as using <command moreinfo="none">tar</command> on the LFS partition that contains
    the root directory (about 250MB uncompressed for a base LFS build), copying
    that file via network transfer or CD-ROM to the new system and expanding
    it.  From that point, a few configuration files will have to be changed.
    Configuration files that may need to be updated include:
    <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/hosts</filename>,
    <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/fstab</filename>,
    <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/passwd</filename>,
    <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/group</filename>,
    
    <phrase revision="sysv">
      <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/shadow</filename>,
      <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/ld.so.conf</filename>,
      <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/sysconfig/rc.site</filename>,
      <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/sysconfig/network</filename>, and
      <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/sysconfig/ifconfig.eth0</filename>.
    </phrase>
    </para>

    <para>A custom kernel may need to be built for the new system depending on
    differences in system hardware and the original kernel
    configuration.</para>

    <note><para>There have been some reports of issues when copying between
    similar but not identical architectures. For instance, the instruction set
    for an Intel system is not identical with an AMD processor and later
    versions of some processors may have instructions that are unavailable in
    earlier versions.</para></note>

    <para>Finally the new system has to be made bootable via <xref linkend="ch-bootable-grub"/>.</para>

    charmap definition and appends the result to the

    <para>After answering a few questions about the location, the script will
    output the name of the time zone (e.g.,

    <emphasis>Canada/Eastern</emphasis> or <emphasis>EST5EDT</emphasis> that
    are not identified by the script but can be used.</para>

    <para>By default, the dynamic loader (<filename class="libraryfile" moreinfo="none">/lib/ld-linux.so.2</filename>) searches through
    <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/lib</filename> and <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/usr/lib</filename> for dynamic libraries that are
    needed by programs as they are run. However, if there are libraries in
    directories other than <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/lib</filename> and
    <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/usr/lib</filename>, these need to be added
    to the <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/ld.so.conf</filename> file in order for the
    dynamic loader to find them. Two directories that are commonly known
    to contain additional libraries are <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/usr/local/lib</filename> and <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/opt/lib</filename>, so add those directories to the
    dynamic loader's search path.</para>

    <para>Create a new file <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/ld.so.conf</filename> by running the
    following:</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">cat &gt; /etc/ld.so.conf &lt;&lt; "EOF"
<literal moreinfo="none"># Begin /etc/ld.so.conf
/usr/local/lib
/opt/lib
</literal>
EOF</userinput></screen>

  <para>If desired, the dynamic loader can also search a directory and
  include the contents of files found there.  Generally the files in
  this include directory are one line specifying the desired library path.
  To add this capability run the following commands:</para>

<screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">cat &gt;&gt; /etc/ld.so.conf &lt;&lt; "EOF"
<literal moreinfo="none"># Add an include directory
include /etc/ld.so.conf.d/*.conf

    <para>The various <quote>sed</quote> instructions after the

    <para>To test the results, issue:</para>

    <para>Disable the installation of the <command moreinfo="none">groups</command> program

    <para id="shadow-login_defs">Instead of using the default
    <emphasis>crypt</emphasis> method, use the more secure

    allows passwords longer than 8 characters. It is also necessary to change
    the obsolete <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/var/spool/mail</filename> location
    for user mailboxes that Shadow uses by default to the <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/var/mail</filename> location used currently. And,
    get rid of <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/bin</filename> and
    <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/sbin</filename> from <envar>PATH</envar>,

    <para>This package contains utilities to add, modify, and delete users and
    groups; set and change their passwords; and perform other administrative
    tasks. For a full explanation of what <emphasis>password shadowing</emphasis>
    means, see the <filename moreinfo="none">doc/HOWTO</filename> file within the unpacked
    source tree. If using Shadow support, keep in mind that programs which need
    to verify passwords (display managers, FTP programs, pop3 daemons, etc.)
    must be Shadow-compliant. That is, they need to be able to work with
    shadowed passwords.</para>

    <para>To enable shadowed passwords, run the following command:</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">pwconv</userinput></screen>

    <para>To enable shadowed group passwords, run:</para>

    <para>Shadow's stock configuration for the <command moreinfo="none">useradd</command>
    utility has a few caveats that need some explanation. First, the default
    action for the <command moreinfo="none">useradd</command> utility is to create the user and
    a group of the same name as the user. By default the user ID (UID) and
    group ID (GID) numbers will begin with 1000. This means if you don't pass
    parameters to <command moreinfo="none">useradd</command>, each user will be a member of a
    unique group on the system. If this behavior is undesirable, you'll need
    to pass the <parameter moreinfo="none">-g</parameter> parameter to
    <command moreinfo="none">useradd</command>. The default parameters are stored in the
    <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/default/useradd</filename> file. You may need to modify two
    parameters in this file to suit your particular needs.</para>

        <term><parameter moreinfo="none">GROUP=1000</parameter></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>This parameter sets the beginning of the group numbers used in
          the /etc/group file. You can modify it to anything you desire. Note
          that <command moreinfo="none">useradd</command> will never reuse a UID or GID. If the
          number identified in this parameter is used, it will use the next
          available number after this. Note also that if you don't have a group
          1000 on your system the first time you use <command moreinfo="none">useradd</command>
          without the <parameter moreinfo="none">-g</parameter> parameter, you'll get a message
          displayed on the terminal that says:
          <computeroutput moreinfo="none">useradd: unknown GID 1000</computeroutput>. You may
          disregard this message and group number 1000 will be used.</para>

      <para>In this section, the test suite for GCC is considered
      critical. Do not skip it under any circumstance.</para>
    </important>

   <para>One set of tests in the GCC test suite is known to exhaust the default
   stack, so increase the stack size prior to running the tests:</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><userinput remap="test" moreinfo="none">ulimit -s 32768</userinput></screen>

    <para>Test the results as a non-privileged user, but do not stop at errors:</para>

    <para>To receive a summary of the test suite results, run:</para>

    <para>For only the summaries, pipe the output through
    <userinput moreinfo="none">grep -A7 Summ</userinput>.</para>

    <para>Results can be compared with those located at <ulink url="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/build-logs/11.0/"/> and
    <ulink url="https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-testresults/"/>.</para>

    <para>Eight tests related to analyzer are known to fail.</para>

    <!-- https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=101751 -->
    <para>One test named <filename moreinfo="none">asan_test.C</filename> is known to

    <!-- https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=100117 -->
    <para>In libstdc++, one test named <filename moreinfo="none">49745.cc</filename> is
    known to fail because the header dependencies in glibc have
    changed.</para>

    <para>In libstdc++, one numpunct test and six tests related to get_time are
    known to fail.  These are all because the locale definitions in glibc have
    changed but libstdc++ does not currently support those changes.</para>

    <para>A few unexpected failures cannot always be avoided. The GCC developers
    are usually aware of these issues, but have not resolved them yet.
    Unless the test results are vastly different from those at the above URL,
    it is safe to continue.</para>

    <!--note><para>
      On some combinations of kernel configuration and AMD processors
      there may be more than 1100 failures in the gcc.target/i386/mpx
      tests (which are designed to test the MPX option on recent
      Intel processors). These can safely be ignored on AMD
      processors. These tests will also fail on Intel processors if MPX support
      is not enabled in the kernel even though it is present on the CPU.

    <para>The GCC build directory is owned by <systemitem class="username" moreinfo="none">

  <!-- already done earlier
    <para>Many packages use the name <command>cc</command> to call the C

    <para>Now that our final toolchain is in place, it is important to again ensure
    that compiling and linking will work as expected. We do this by performing
    some sanity checks:</para>

    <screen os="a" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">echo 'int main(){}' &gt; dummy.c
cc dummy.c -v -Wl,--verbose &amp;&gt; dummy.log
readelf -l a.out | grep ': /lib'</userinput></screen>

    <para os="b">There should be no errors,
  and the output of the last command will be (allowing for
  platform-specific differences in the dynamic linker name):</para>

    <screen os="c" format="linespecific"><computeroutput moreinfo="none">[Requesting program interpreter: /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2]</computeroutput></screen>

    <para os="d">Now make sure that we're setup to use the correct start files:</para>

    <screen os="e" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">grep -o '/usr/lib.*/crt[1in].*succeeded' dummy.log</userinput></screen>

    <para os="f">The output of the last command should be:</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><computeroutput moreinfo="none">/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/11.2.0/../../../../lib/crt1.o succeeded
/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/11.2.0/../../../../lib/crti.o succeeded
/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/11.2.0/../../../../lib/crtn.o succeeded</computeroutput></screen>

  <para>Depending on your machine architecture, the above may differ slightly.
  The difference will be the name of the directory
  after <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/usr/lib/gcc</filename>. The important
  thing to look for here is that <command moreinfo="none">gcc</command> has found all three
  <filename moreinfo="none">crt*.o</filename> files under the
  <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/usr/lib</filename> directory.</para>

    <para os="g">Verify that the compiler is searching for the correct header
  files:</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">grep -B4 '^ /usr/include' dummy.log</userinput></screen>

    <para os="h">This command should return the following output:</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><computeroutput moreinfo="none">#include &lt;...&gt; search starts here:
 /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/11.2.0/include
 /usr/local/include
 /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/11.2.0/include-fixed
 /usr/include</computeroutput></screen>

   <para>Again, the directory named after your target triplet may be
   different than the above, depending on your system architecture.</para>

    <para os="i">Next, verify that the new linker is being used with the correct search paths:</para>

    <screen os="j" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">grep 'SEARCH.*/usr/lib' dummy.log |sed 's|; |\n|g'</userinput></screen>

    <para os="k">References to paths that have components with '-linux-gnu' should
  be ignored, but otherwise the output of the last command should be:</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><computeroutput moreinfo="none">SEARCH_DIR("/usr/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/lib64")
SEARCH_DIR("/usr/local/lib64")
SEARCH_DIR("/lib64")
SEARCH_DIR("/usr/lib64")
SEARCH_DIR("/usr/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/lib")
SEARCH_DIR("/usr/local/lib")
SEARCH_DIR("/lib")
SEARCH_DIR("/usr/lib");</computeroutput></screen>

   <para>A 32-bit system may see a few different directories. For example, here
   is the output from an i686 machine:</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><computeroutput moreinfo="none">SEARCH_DIR("/usr/i686-pc-linux-gnu/lib32")
SEARCH_DIR("/usr/local/lib32")
SEARCH_DIR("/lib32")
SEARCH_DIR("/usr/lib32")
SEARCH_DIR("/usr/i686-pc-linux-gnu/lib")
SEARCH_DIR("/usr/local/lib")
SEARCH_DIR("/lib")
SEARCH_DIR("/usr/lib");</computeroutput></screen>

    <para os="l">Next make sure that we're using the correct libc:</para>

    <screen os="m" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">grep "/lib.*/libc.so.6 " dummy.log</userinput></screen>

    <para os="n">The output of the last command should be:</para>

    <screen os="o" format="linespecific"><computeroutput moreinfo="none">attempt to open /usr/lib/libc.so.6 succeeded</computeroutput></screen>

    <para os="p">Make sure GCC is using the correct dynamic linker:</para>

    <screen os="q" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">grep found dummy.log</userinput></screen>

    <para os="r">The output of the last command should be (allowing for
  platform-specific differences in dynamic linker name):</para>

    <screen os="s" format="linespecific"><computeroutput moreinfo="none">found ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 at /usr/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2</computeroutput></screen>

    <para os="t">If the output does not appear as shown above or is not received
  at all, then something is seriously wrong. Investigate and retrace the
  steps to find out where the problem is and correct it. <!--The most likely
  reason is that something went wrong with the specs file adjustment.--> Any
  issues will need to be resolved before continuing with the process.</para>

    <para os="u">Once everything is working correctly, clean up the test files:</para>

    <screen os="v" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">rm -v dummy.c a.out dummy.log</userinput></screen>

    <para>Finally, move a misplaced file:</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><userinput remap="install" moreinfo="none">mkdir -pv /usr/share/gdb/auto-load/usr/lib
mv -v /usr/lib/*gdb.py /usr/share/gdb/auto-load/usr/lib</userinput></screen>

    <para>Many applications still expect the linker to be able to find

    <para>Finally, make sure that old applications that look for
    <filename class="libraryfile" moreinfo="none">-lcurses</filename> at build time are still
    buildable:</para>

    <para>If desired, install the Ncurses documentation:</para>

    <note>

      <para>The instructions above don't create non-wide-character Ncurses
      libraries since no package installed by compiling from sources would link
      against them at runtime. However, the only known binary-only
      applications that link against non-wide-character Ncurses libraries 
      require version 5.  If you must have such libraries because of some binary-only
      application or to be compliant with LSB, build the package again with the
      following commands:</para>

<screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">make distclean

      <para>
        You should update OpenSSL when a new version which fixes vulnerabilities
        is announced. The releases run in series, with a letter for each release
        after the initial release (e.g. 1.1.1, 1.1.1a, 1.1.1b, etc). Because LFS
        installs only the shared libraries, there is no need to recompile packages
        which link to <filename class="libraryfile" moreinfo="none">libcrypto.so</filename> or
        <filename class="libraryfile" moreinfo="none">libssl.so</filename>
        <emphasis>when upgrading in the same series.</emphasis>
      </para>

      <para>
        However, any running programs linked to those libraries need to be stopped
        and restarted. Read the related entries in
        <xref linkend="pkgmgmt-upgrade-issues"/> for details.

  <sect2 role="installation">
    <title>Installation of Vim</title>

    <para>First, change the default location of the <filename moreinfo="none">vimrc</filename>
    configuration file to <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/etc</filename>:</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><userinput remap="pre" moreinfo="none">echo '#define SYS_VIMRC_FILE "/etc/vimrc"' &gt;&gt; src/feature.h</userinput></screen>

    <para>Prepare vim for compilation:</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><userinput remap="configure" moreinfo="none">./configure --prefix=/usr</userinput></screen>

    <para>Compile the package:</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><userinput remap="make" moreinfo="none">make</userinput></screen>

    <para>To prepare the tests, ensure that user 
    <systemitem class="username" moreinfo="none">tester</systemitem> can write 
    to the source tree:</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><userinput remap="test" moreinfo="none">chown -Rv tester .</userinput></screen>

    <para>Now run the tests as user <systemitem class="username" moreinfo="none">tester</systemitem>:</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><userinput remap="test" moreinfo="none">su tester -c "LANG=en_US.UTF-8 make -j1 test" &amp;&gt; vim-test.log</userinput></screen>

    <para>The test suite outputs a lot of binary data to the screen.  This can
    cause issues with the settings of the current terminal.  The problem can be
    avoided by redirecting the output to a log file as shown above.  A
    successful test will result in the words "ALL DONE" in the log file
    at completion.</para>

    <para>Install the package:</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><userinput remap="install" moreinfo="none">make install</userinput></screen>

    <para>Many users are used to using <command moreinfo="none">vi</command> instead of
    <command moreinfo="none">vim</command>. To allow execution of <command moreinfo="none">vim</command>
    when users habitually enter <command moreinfo="none">vi</command>, create a
    symlink for both the binary and the man page in the provided
    languages:</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><userinput remap="install" moreinfo="none">ln -sv vim /usr/bin/vi
for L in  /usr/share/man/{,*/}man1/vim.1; do
    ln -sv vim.1 $(dirname $L)/vi.1
done</userinput></screen>

    <para>By default, vim's documentation is installed in <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/usr/share/vim</filename>. The following symlink
    allows the documentation to be accessed via <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/usr/share/doc/vim-8.2.3337</filename>, making
    it consistent with the location of documentation for other packages:</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><userinput remap="install" moreinfo="none">ln -sv ../vim/vim82/doc /usr/share/doc/vim-8.2.3337</userinput></screen>

    <para>If an X Window System is going to be installed on the LFS
    system, it may be necessary to recompile vim after installing X. Vim
    comes with a GUI version of the editor that requires X and some
    additional libraries to be installed. For more information on this
    process, refer to the vim documentation and the vim installation page
    in the BLFS book at <ulink url="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/11.0/postlfs/vim.html"/>.</para>

    <title>Configuring Vim</title>

    <indexterm zone="conf-vim" significance="normal">
      <primary sortas="e-/etc/vimrc">/etc/vimrc</primary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>By default, <command moreinfo="none">vim</command> runs in vi-incompatible mode.
    This may be new to users who have used other editors in the past. The
    <quote>nocompatible</quote> setting is included below to highlight the
    fact that a new behavior is being used. It also reminds those who would
    change to <quote>compatible</quote> mode that it should be the first
    setting in the configuration file. This is necessary because it changes
    other settings, and overrides must come after this setting. Create a default
    <command moreinfo="none">vim</command> configuration file by running the following:</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">cat &gt; /etc/vimrc &lt;&lt; "EOF"
<literal moreinfo="none">" Begin /etc/vimrc

" Ensure defaults are set before customizing settings, not after
source $VIMRUNTIME/defaults.vim
let skip_defaults_vim=1 

set nocompatible
set backspace=2
set mouse=
syntax on
if (&amp;term == "xterm") || (&amp;term == "putty")
  set background=dark
endif

" End /etc/vimrc</literal>
EOF</userinput></screen>

    <para>The <parameter moreinfo="none">set nocompatible</parameter> setting makes
    <command moreinfo="none">vim</command> behave in a more useful way (the default) than the
    vi-compatible manner. Remove the <quote>no</quote> to keep the old
    <command moreinfo="none">vi</command> behavior. The <parameter moreinfo="none">set backspace=2</parameter>
    setting allows backspacing over line breaks, autoindents, and the start of
    an insert. The <parameter moreinfo="none">syntax on</parameter> parameter enables vim's syntax
    highlighting.  The <parameter moreinfo="none">set mouse=</parameter> setting enables
    proper pasting of text with the mouse when working in chroot or over a
    remote connection.  Finally, the <emphasis>if</emphasis> statement with the
    <parameter moreinfo="none">set background=dark</parameter> setting corrects
    <command moreinfo="none">vim</command>'s guess about the background color of some terminal
    emulators. This gives the highlighting a better color scheme for use on the
    black background of these programs.</para>

    <para>Documentation for other available options can be obtained by
    running the following command:</para>

<screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">vim -c ':options'</userinput></screen>

    <note>
      <para>By default, vim only installs spell files for the English language.
      To install spell files for your preferred language, download the
      <filename moreinfo="none">*.spl</filename> and optionally, the <filename moreinfo="none">*.sug</filename>
      files for your language and character encoding from <ulink url="ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/runtime/spell/"/> and save them to
      <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/usr/share/vim/vim82/spell/</filename>.</para>

      <para>To use these spell files, some configuration in
      <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/vimrc</filename> is needed, e.g.:</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><literal moreinfo="none">set spelllang=en,ru
set spell</literal></screen>

      <para>For more information, see the appropriate README file located
      at the URL above.</para>

  <title>About Debugging Symbols</title>

  <para>Most programs and libraries are, by default, compiled with
  debugging symbols included (with <command moreinfo="none">gcc</command>'s
  <parameter moreinfo="none">-g</parameter> option). This means that when debugging a
  program or library that was compiled with debugging information,
  the debugger can provide not only memory addresses, but also
  the names of the routines and variables.</para>

  <para>However, the inclusion of these debugging symbols enlarges a
  program or library significantly. The following is an example of the
  amount of space these symbols occupy:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>A <command moreinfo="none">bash</command> binary with debugging symbols:
      1200 KB</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>A <command moreinfo="none">bash</command> binary without debugging symbols:
      480 KB</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Glibc and GCC files (<filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/lib</filename>
      and <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/usr/lib</filename>) with debugging
      symbols: 87 MB</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>Glibc and GCC files without debugging symbols: 16 MB</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>Sizes may vary depending on which compiler and C library were used,
  but when comparing programs with and without debugging symbols, the
  difference will usually be a factor between two and five.</para>

  <para>Because most users will never use a debugger on their system software,
  a lot of disk space can be regained by removing these symbols. The next
  section shows how to strip all debugging symbols from the programs and
  libraries.</para>

</sect1>
  <sect1 id="ch-system-stripping">
  <?dbhtml filename="stripping.html"?>

  <title>Stripping</title>

  <para>This section is optional.  If the intended user is not a 
  programmer and does not plan to do
  any debugging on the system software, the system size can be decreased
  by about 2 GB by removing the debugging symbols from binaries and
  libraries. This causes no inconvenience other than not being able to
  debug the software fully anymore.</para>

  <para>Most people who use the commands mentioned below do not
  experience any difficulties. However, it is easy to make a typo and
  render the new system unusable, so before running the
  <command moreinfo="none">strip</command> commands, it is a good idea to make a
  backup of the LFS system in its current state.</para>

  <para>The debugging symbols for selected libraries are placed
  in separate files.  This debugging information is needed if running 
  regression tests that use <ulink url="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/11.0//general/valgrind.html">valgrind</ulink> or <ulink url="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/11.0//general/gdb.html">gdb</ulink> later in BLFS.
  </para>

  <para>Note that <command moreinfo="none">strip</command> will overwrite the binary or library
  file it is processing.  This can crash the processes using code or data from
  the file.  If the process running <command moreinfo="none">strip</command> itself is
  affected, the binary or library being stripped can be destroyed and can
  make the system completely unusable.  To avoid it, we'll copy some libraries
  and binaries into <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/tmp</filename>, strip them
  there, and install them back with the <command moreinfo="none">install</command> command.
  Read the related entry in <xref linkend="pkgmgmt-upgrade-issues"/> for the
  rationale to use the <command moreinfo="none">install</command> command here.</para>

  <note><para>The ELF loader's name is ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 on 64-bit systems
  and ld-linux.so.2 on 32-bit systems.  The contruct below selects the 
  correct name for the current architecture.</para></note>

  <para>If the virtual kernel file systems have been unmounted, either manually

  <para>There are also several files installed in the /usr/lib and /usr/libexec

  shared libraries, specially when using also non-autotools build systems.
  To remove them, run:</para>

  <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Booting a Linux system involves several tasks.  The process must
    mount both virtual and real file systems, initialize devices, activate swap,
    check file systems for integrity, mount any swap partitions or files, set
    the system clock, bring up networking, start any daemons required by the
    system, and accomplish any other custom tasks needed by the user.  This
    process must be organized to ensure the tasks are performed in the correct
    order but, at the same time, be executed as fast as possible.</para>

  <sect2 id="sysv-desc">
    <title>System V</title>

    <para>System V is the classic boot process that has been used in Unix and
    Unix-like systems such as Linux since about 1983.  It consists of a small
    program, <command moreinfo="none">init</command>, that sets up basic programs such as
    <command moreinfo="none">login</command> (via getty) and runs a script.  This script,
    usually named <command moreinfo="none">rc</command>,  controls the execution of a set of
    additional scripts that perform the tasks required to initialize the
    system.</para>

    <para>The <command moreinfo="none">init</command> program is controlled by the 
    <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/inittab</filename> file and is organized into run levels that
    can be run by the user:</para>

<literallayout format="linespecific" class="normal">0 — halt
1 — Single user mode
2 — Multiuser, without networking
3 — Full multiuser mode
4 — User definable
5 — Full multiuser mode with display manager
6 — reboot</literallayout>

    <para>The usual default run level is 3 or 5.</para>

  <title>Overview of Device and Module Handling</title>

  <indexterm zone="ch-config-udev" significance="normal">
    <primary sortas="a-Udev">Udev</primary>
    <secondary>usage</secondary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>In <xref linkend="chapter-building-system"/>, we installed the udev
  package when <phrase revision="sysv">eudev</phrase>
   was built. Before we go into the
  details regarding how this works, a brief history of previous methods of
  handling devices is in order.</para>

  <para>Linux systems in general traditionally used a static device creation
  method, whereby a great many device nodes were created under <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/dev</filename> (sometimes literally thousands of nodes),
  regardless of whether the corresponding hardware devices actually existed. This
  was typically done via a <command moreinfo="none">MAKEDEV</command> script, which contains a
  number of calls to the <command moreinfo="none">mknod</command> program with the relevant
  major and minor device numbers for every possible device that might exist in
  the world.</para>

  <para>Using the udev method, only those devices which are detected by the
  kernel get device nodes created for them. Because these device nodes will be
  created each time the system boots, they will be stored on a <systemitem class="filesystem" moreinfo="none">devtmpfs</systemitem> file system (a virtual file system
  that resides entirely in system memory). Device nodes do not require much
  space, so the memory that is used is negligible.</para>

  <sect2>
    <title>History</title>

    <para>In February 2000, a new filesystem called <systemitem class="filesystem" moreinfo="none">devfs</systemitem> was merged into the 2.3.46 kernel
    and was made available during the 2.4 series of stable kernels. Although
    it was present in the kernel source itself, this method of creating devices
    dynamically never received overwhelming support from the core kernel
    developers.</para>

    <para>The main problem with the approach adopted by <systemitem class="filesystem" moreinfo="none">devfs</systemitem> was the way it handled device
    detection, creation, and naming. The latter issue, that of device node
    naming, was perhaps the most critical. It is generally accepted that if
    device names are allowed to be configurable, then the device naming policy
    should be up to a system administrator, not imposed on them by any
    particular developer(s). The <systemitem class="filesystem" moreinfo="none">devfs</systemitem> file system also suffered from race
    conditions that were inherent in its design and could not be fixed without a
    substantial revision to the kernel. It was marked as deprecated for a long
    period – due to a lack of maintenance – and was finally removed
    from the kernel in June, 2006.</para>

    <para>With the development of the unstable 2.5 kernel tree, later released
    as the 2.6 series of stable kernels, a new virtual filesystem called
    <systemitem class="filesystem" moreinfo="none">sysfs</systemitem> came to be. The job of
    <systemitem class="filesystem" moreinfo="none">sysfs</systemitem> is to export a view of
    the system's hardware configuration to userspace processes. With this
    userspace-visible representation, the possibility of developing a userspace
    replacement for <systemitem class="filesystem" moreinfo="none">devfs</systemitem> became
    much more realistic.</para>

  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>Udev Implementation</title>

    <sect3>
      <title>Sysfs</title>

      <para>The <systemitem class="filesystem" moreinfo="none">sysfs</systemitem> filesystem
      was mentioned briefly above. One may wonder how <systemitem class="filesystem" moreinfo="none">sysfs</systemitem> knows about the devices present on
      a system and what device numbers should be used for them. Drivers that
      have been compiled into the kernel directly register their objects with a
      <systemitem class="filesystem" moreinfo="none">sysfs</systemitem> (devtmpfs internally)
      as they are detected by the kernel. For drivers compiled as modules, this
      registration will happen when the module is loaded. Once the <systemitem class="filesystem" moreinfo="none">sysfs</systemitem> filesystem is mounted (on /sys),
      data which the drivers register with <systemitem class="filesystem" moreinfo="none">sysfs</systemitem> are available to userspace
      processes and to udevd for processing (including modifications to device
      nodes).</para>

    </sect3>

    <sect3>
      <title>Device Node Creation</title>

      <para>Device files are created by the kernel by the <systemitem class="filesystem" moreinfo="none">devtmpfs</systemitem> filesystem.  Any driver that
      wishes to register a device node will go through the <systemitem class="filesystem" moreinfo="none">devtmpfs</systemitem> (via the driver core) to do it.
      When a <systemitem class="filesystem" moreinfo="none">devtmpfs</systemitem> instance is
      mounted on <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/dev</filename>, the device node
      will initially be created with a fixed name, permissions, and
      owner.</para>

      <para>A short time later, the kernel will send a uevent to <command moreinfo="none">
      udevd</command>.  Based on the rules specified in the files within the
      <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/etc/udev/rules.d</filename>, <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/usr/lib/udev/rules.d</filename>, and <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/run/udev/rules.d</filename> directories, <command moreinfo="none">
      udevd</command> will create additional symlinks to the device node, or
      change its permissions, owner, or group, or modify the internal
      <command moreinfo="none">udevd</command> database entry (name) for that object.</para>

      <para>The rules in these three directories are numbered and all three
      directories are merged together. If <command moreinfo="none">udevd</command> can't find a
      rule for the device it is creating, it will leave the permissions and
      ownership at whatever <systemitem class="filesystem" moreinfo="none">devtmpfs</systemitem> used initially.</para> </sect3>
      
    <sect3 id="module-loading">
      <title>Module Loading</title>

      <para>Device drivers compiled as modules may have aliases built into them.
      Aliases are visible in the output of the <command moreinfo="none">modinfo</command>
      program and are usually related to the bus-specific identifiers of devices
      supported by a module. For example, the <emphasis>snd-fm801</emphasis>
      driver supports PCI devices with vendor ID 0x1319 and device ID 0x0801,
      and has an alias of <quote>pci:v00001319d00000801sv*sd*bc04sc01i*</quote>.
      For most devices, the bus driver exports the alias of the driver that
      would handle the device via <systemitem class="filesystem" moreinfo="none">sysfs</systemitem>. E.g., the
      <filename moreinfo="none">/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:0d.0/modalias</filename> file
      might contain the string
      <quote>pci:v00001319d00000801sv00001319sd00001319bc04sc01i00</quote>.
      The default rules provided with udev will cause <command moreinfo="none">udevd</command>
      to call out to <command moreinfo="none">/sbin/modprobe</command> with the contents of the
      <envar>MODALIAS</envar> uevent environment variable (which should be the
      same as the contents of the <filename moreinfo="none">modalias</filename> file in sysfs),
      thus loading all modules whose aliases match this string after wildcard
      expansion.</para>

      <para>In this example, this means that, in addition to
      <emphasis>snd-fm801</emphasis>, the obsolete (and unwanted)
      <emphasis>forte</emphasis> driver will be loaded if it is
      available. See below for ways in which the loading of unwanted drivers can
      be prevented.</para>

      <para>The kernel itself is also able to load modules for network
      protocols, filesystems, and NLS support on demand.</para>

    <sect3>
      <title>Handling Hotpluggable/Dynamic Devices</title>

      <para>When you plug in a device, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) MP3
      player, the kernel recognizes that the device is now connected and
      generates a uevent. This uevent is then handled by
      <command moreinfo="none">udevd</command> as described above.</para>

    </sect3>

  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>Problems with Loading Modules and Creating Devices</title>

    <para>There are a few possible problems when it comes to automatically
    creating device nodes.</para>

    <sect3>
      <title>A kernel module is not loaded automatically</title>

      <para>Udev will only load a module if it has a bus-specific alias and the
      bus driver properly exports the necessary aliases to <systemitem class="filesystem" moreinfo="none">sysfs</systemitem>. In other cases, one should
      arrange module loading by other means. With Linux-5.13.12, udev is
      known to load properly-written drivers for INPUT, IDE, PCI, USB, SCSI,
      SERIO, and FireWire devices.</para>

      <para>To determine if the device driver you require has the necessary
      support for udev, run <command moreinfo="none">modinfo</command> with the module name as
      the argument.  Now try locating the device directory under
      <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/sys/bus</filename> and check whether there is
      a <filename moreinfo="none">modalias</filename> file there.</para>

      <para>If the <filename moreinfo="none">modalias</filename> file exists in <systemitem class="filesystem" moreinfo="none">sysfs</systemitem>, the driver supports the device and
      can talk to it directly, but doesn't have the alias, it is a bug in the
      driver. Load the driver without the help from udev and expect the issue
      to be fixed later.</para>

      <para>If there is no <filename moreinfo="none">modalias</filename> file in the relevant
      directory under <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/sys/bus</filename>, this
      means that the kernel developers have not yet added modalias support to
      this bus type. With Linux-5.13.12, this is the case with ISA
      busses. Expect this issue to be fixed in later kernel versions.</para>

      <para>Udev is not intended to load <quote>wrapper</quote> drivers such as
      <emphasis>snd-pcm-oss</emphasis> and non-hardware drivers such as
      <emphasis>loop</emphasis> at all.</para>

    </sect3>

    <sect3>
      <title>A kernel module is not loaded automatically, and udev is not
      intended to load it</title>

      <para>If the <quote>wrapper</quote> module only enhances the
      functionality provided by some other module (e.g.,
      <emphasis>snd-pcm-oss</emphasis> enhances the functionality of
      <emphasis>snd-pcm</emphasis> by making the sound cards available to OSS
      applications), configure <command moreinfo="none">modprobe</command> to load the wrapper
      after udev loads the wrapped module. To do this, add a
      <quote>softdep</quote> line to the corresponding
      <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/modprobe.d/<replaceable>&lt;filename&gt;</replaceable>.conf</filename>
      file. For example:</para>

<screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><literal moreinfo="none">softdep snd-pcm post: snd-pcm-oss</literal></screen>

      <para>Note that the <quote>softdep</quote> command also allows
      <literal moreinfo="none">pre:</literal> dependencies, or a mixture of both
      <literal moreinfo="none">pre:</literal> and <literal moreinfo="none">post:</literal> dependencies.  See 
      the <filename moreinfo="none">modprobe.d(5)</filename> manual page for more information
      on <quote>softdep</quote> syntax and capabilities.</para>

      <para revision="sysv">If the module in question is not a wrapper and is 
      useful by itself, configure the <command moreinfo="none">modules</command> bootscript to 
      load this module on system boot. To do this, add the module name to the
      <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/sysconfig/modules</filename> file on a separate line.
      This works for wrapper modules too, but is suboptimal in that case.</para>

    <sect3>
      <title>Udev loads some unwanted module</title>

      <para>Either don't build the module, or blacklist it in a

      <emphasis>forte</emphasis> module in the example below:</para>

<screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><literal moreinfo="none">blacklist forte</literal></screen>

      <para>Blacklisted modules can still be loaded manually with the
      explicit <command moreinfo="none">modprobe</command> command.</para>

    </sect3>

    <sect3>
      <title>Udev creates a device incorrectly, or makes a wrong symlink</title>

      <para>This usually happens if a rule unexpectedly matches a device. For
      example, a poorly-written rule can match both a SCSI disk (as desired)
      and the corresponding SCSI generic device (incorrectly) by vendor.
      Find the offending rule and make it more specific, with the help of the
      <command moreinfo="none">udevadm info</command> command.</para>

    </sect3>

    <sect3>
      <title>Udev rule works unreliably</title>

      <para>This may be another manifestation of the previous problem. If not,
      and your rule uses <systemitem class="filesystem" moreinfo="none">sysfs</systemitem>
      attributes, it may be a kernel timing issue, to be fixed in later kernels.
      For now, you can work around it by creating a rule that waits for the used
      <systemitem class="filesystem" moreinfo="none">sysfs</systemitem> attribute and appending
      it to the <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/udev/rules.d/10-wait_for_sysfs.rules</filename>
      file (create this file if it does not exist). Please notify the LFS
      Development list if you do so and it helps.</para>

    </sect3>

    <sect3>
      <title>Udev does not create a device</title>

      <para>Further text assumes that the driver is built statically into the
      kernel or already loaded as a module, and that you have already checked
      that udev doesn't create a misnamed device.</para>

      <para>Udev has no information needed to create a device node if a kernel
      driver does not export its data to
      <systemitem class="filesystem" moreinfo="none">sysfs</systemitem>. This is most common
      with third party drivers from outside the kernel tree. Create a static
      device node in <filename moreinfo="none">/usr/lib/udev/devices</filename> with the
      appropriate major/minor numbers (see the file
      <filename moreinfo="none">devices.txt</filename> inside the kernel documentation or the
      documentation provided by the third party driver vendor). The static
      device node will be copied to <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/dev</filename>
      by <command moreinfo="none">udev</command>.</para>

    </sect3>

    <sect3>
      <title>Device naming order changes randomly after rebooting</title>

      <para>This is due to the fact that udev, by design, handles uevents and
      loads modules in parallel, and thus in an unpredictable order. This will
      never be <quote>fixed</quote>. You should not rely upon the kernel device
      names being stable. Instead, create your own rules that make symlinks with
      stable names based on some stable attributes of the device, such as a
      serial number or the output of various *_id utilities installed by udev.
      See <xref linkend="ch-config-symlinks"/> and
      <xref linkend="ch-config-network"/> for examples.</para>

  <sect2 revision="sysv">

    <title>Network Devices</title>

    <para>Udev, by default, names network devices according to Firmware/BIOS
    data or physical characteristics like the bus, slot, or MAC address.  The
    purpose of this naming convention is to ensure that network devices are
    named consistently and not based on the time the network card was
    discovered.  For example, on a computer having two network cards made by
    Intel and Realtek, the network card manufactured by Intel may become eth0
    and the Realtek card becomes eth1. In some cases, after a reboot the cards
    could get renumbered the other way around.</para>
    
    <para>In the new naming scheme, typical network device names would then
    be something like enp5s0 or wlp3s0.  If this naming convention is not
    desired, the traditional naming scheme or a custom scheme can be
    implemented.</para>

    <sect3>
      <title>Disabling Persistent Naming on the Kernel Command Line</title>
   
      <para>The traditional naming scheme using eth0, eth1, etc can be
      restored by adding <userinput moreinfo="none">net.ifnames=0</userinput> on the 
      kernel command line.  This is most appropriate for those systems
      that have only one ethernet device of the same type.  Laptops
      often have multiple ethernet connections that are named eth0 and 
      wlan0 and are also candidates for this method.  The command line 
      is passed in the GRUB configuration file. 
      See <xref linkend="grub-cfg"/>.</para>
    </sect3>

    <sect3>
      <title>Creating Custom Udev Rules</title>
   
      <para>The naming scheme can be customized by creating custom udev
      rules.  A script has been included that generates the initial rules.
      Generate these rules by running:</para>

<screen role="install" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">bash /usr/lib/udev/init-net-rules.sh</userinput></screen>

      <para> Now, inspect the
      <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules</filename> file, to
      find out which name was assigned to which network device:</para>

<screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">cat /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules</userinput></screen>

      <note><para>In some cases such as when MAC addresses have been assigned to
      a network card manually or in a virtual environment such as Qemu or Xen,
      the network rules file may not have been generated because addresses
      are not consistently assigned.  In these cases, this method cannot
      be used.</para></note>
  
      <para>The file begins with a comment block followed by two lines for each
      NIC. The first line for each NIC is a commented description showing its
      hardware IDs (e.g. its PCI vendor and device IDs, if it's a PCI card),
      along with its driver in parentheses, if the driver can be found. Neither
      the hardware ID nor the driver is used to determine which name to give an
      interface; this information is only for reference. The second line is the
      udev rule that matches this NIC and actually assigns it a name.</para>
  
      <para>All udev rules are made up of several keys, separated by commas and
      optional whitespace. This rule's keys and an explanation of each of them
      are as follows:</para>
  
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><literal moreinfo="none">SUBSYSTEM=="net"</literal> - This tells udev to ignore
          devices that are not network cards.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para><literal moreinfo="none">ACTION=="add"</literal> - This tells udev to ignore this
          rule for a uevent that isn't an add ("remove" and "change" uevents also
          happen, but don't need to rename network interfaces).</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para><literal moreinfo="none">DRIVERS=="?*"</literal> - This exists so that udev will
          ignore VLAN or bridge sub-interfaces (because these sub-interfaces do
          not have drivers). These sub-interfaces are skipped because the name
          that would be assigned would collide with their parent devices.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para><literal moreinfo="none">ATTR{address}</literal> - The value of this key is the
          NIC's MAC address.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para><literal moreinfo="none">ATTR{type}=="1"</literal> - This ensures the rule only
          matches the primary interface in the case of certain wireless drivers
          which create multiple virtual interfaces. The secondary interfaces are
          skipped for the same reason that VLAN and bridge sub-interfaces are
          skipped: there would be a name collision otherwise.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para><literal moreinfo="none">NAME</literal> - The value of this key is the name that
          udev will assign to this interface.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
  
      <para>The value of <literal moreinfo="none">NAME</literal> is the important part. Make sure
      you know which name has been assigned to each of your network cards before
      proceeding, and be sure to use that <literal moreinfo="none">NAME</literal> value when
      creating your configuration files below.</para>

    <title>CD-ROM symlinks</title>

    <para>Some software that you may want to install later (e.g., various
    media players) expect the <filename class="symlink" moreinfo="none">/dev/cdrom</filename>
    and <filename class="symlink" moreinfo="none">/dev/dvd</filename> symlinks to exist, and
    to point to a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM device. Also, it may be convenient to put
    references to those symlinks into <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/fstab</filename>. Udev
    comes with a script that will generate rules files to create these symlinks
    for you, depending on the capabilities of each device, but you need to
    decide which of two modes of operation you wish to have the script use.</para>

    <para>First, the script can operate in <quote>by-path</quote> mode (used by
    default for USB and FireWire devices), where the rules it creates depend on
    the physical path to the CD or DVD device. Second, it can operate in
    <quote>by-id</quote> mode (default for IDE and SCSI devices), where the
    rules it creates depend on identification strings stored on the CD or DVD
    device itself. The path is determined by udev's <command moreinfo="none">path_id</command>
    script, and the identification strings are read from the hardware by its
    <command moreinfo="none">ata_id</command> or <command moreinfo="none">scsi_id</command> programs, depending
    on which type of device you have.</para>

    <para>There are advantages to each approach; the correct approach to use
    will depend on what kinds of device changes may happen. If you expect the
    physical path to the device (that is, the ports and/or slots that it plugs
    into) to change, for example because you plan on moving the drive to a
    different IDE port or a different USB connector, then you should use the
    <quote>by-id</quote> mode. On the other hand, if you expect the device's
    identification to change, for example because it may die, and you would
    replace it with a different device with the same capabilities and which
    is plugged into the same connectors, then you should use the
    <quote>by-path</quote> mode.</para>

    <para>If either type of change is possible with your drive, then choose a
    mode based on the type of change you expect to happen more often.</para>

<!-- If you use by-id mode, the symlinks will survive even the transition
     to libata for IDE drives, but that is not for the book. -->

    <important><para>External devices (for example, a USB-connected CD drive)
    should not use by-path persistence, because each time the device is plugged
    into a new external port, its physical path will change. All
    externally-connected devices will have this problem if you write udev rules
    to recognize them by their physical path; the problem is not limited to CD
    and DVD drives.</para></important>

    <para>If you wish to see the values that the udev scripts will use, then
    for the appropriate CD-ROM device, find the corresponding directory under
    <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/sys</filename> (e.g., this can be
    <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/sys/block/hdd</filename>) and
    run a command similar to the following:</para>

<screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">udevadm test /sys/block/hdd</userinput></screen>

    <para>Look at the lines containing the output of various *_id programs.
    The <quote>by-id</quote> mode will use the ID_SERIAL value if it exists and
    is not empty, otherwise it will use a combination of ID_MODEL and
    ID_REVISION. The <quote>by-path</quote> mode will use the ID_PATH value.</para>

    <para>If the default mode is not suitable for your situation, then the
    following modification can be made to the
    <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/udev/rules.d/83-cdrom-symlinks.rules</filename> file,
    as follows (where <replaceable>mode</replaceable> is one of
    <quote>by-id</quote> or <quote>by-path</quote>):</para>

<screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">sed -e 's/"write_cd_rules"/"write_cd_rules <replaceable>mode</replaceable>"/' \
    -i /etc/udev/rules.d/83-cdrom-symlinks.rules</userinput></screen>

    <para>Note that it is not necessary to create the rules files or symlinks
    at this time because you have bind-mounted the host's
    <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/dev</filename> directory into the LFS system
    and we assume the symlinks exist on the host. The rules and symlinks will
    be created the first time you boot your LFS system.</para>

    <para>However, if you have multiple CD-ROM devices, then the symlinks
    generated at that time may point to different devices than they point to on
    your host because devices are not discovered in a predictable order. The
    assignments created when you first boot the LFS system will be stable, so
    this is only an issue if you need the symlinks on both systems to point to
    the same device. If you need that, then inspect (and possibly edit) the
    generated <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-cd.rules</filename>
    file after booting, to make sure the assigned symlinks match what you need.</para>

    <title>Dealing with duplicate devices</title>

    <para>As explained in <xref linkend="ch-config-udev"/>, the order in
    which devices with the same function appear in
    <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/dev</filename> is essentially random.
    E.g., if you have a USB web camera and a TV tuner, sometimes
    <filename moreinfo="none">/dev/video0</filename> refers to the camera and
    <filename moreinfo="none">/dev/video1</filename> refers to the tuner, and sometimes
    after a reboot the order changes.
    For all classes of hardware except sound cards and network cards, this is
    fixable by creating udev rules for custom persistent symlinks.
    The case of network cards is covered separately in
    <xref linkend="ch-config-network"/>, and sound card configuration can
    be found in <ulink url="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/11.0/postlfs/devices.html">BLFS</ulink>.</para>

    <para>For each of your devices that is likely to have this problem
    (even if the problem doesn't exist in your current Linux distribution),
    find the corresponding directory under
    <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/sys/class</filename> or
    <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/sys/block</filename>.
    For video devices, this may be
    <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/sys/class/video4linux/video<replaceable>X</replaceable></filename>.
    Figure out the attributes that identify the device uniquely (usually,
    vendor and product IDs and/or serial numbers work):</para>

<screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">udevadm info -a -p /sys/class/video4linux/video0</userinput></screen>

    <para>Then write rules that create the symlinks, e.g.:</para>

<screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">cat &gt; /etc/udev/rules.d/83-duplicate_devs.rules &lt;&lt; "EOF"
<literal moreinfo="none">
# Persistent symlinks for webcam and tuner
KERNEL=="video*", ATTRS{idProduct}=="1910", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0d81", SYMLINK+="webcam"
KERNEL=="video*", ATTRS{device}=="0x036f",  ATTRS{vendor}=="0x109e", SYMLINK+="tvtuner"
</literal>
EOF</userinput></screen>

    <para>The result is that <filename moreinfo="none">/dev/video0</filename> and
    <filename moreinfo="none">/dev/video1</filename> devices still refer randomly to the tuner
    and the web camera (and thus should never be used directly), but there are
    symlinks <filename moreinfo="none">/dev/tvtuner</filename> and
    <filename moreinfo="none">/dev/webcam</filename> that always point to the correct
    device.</para>

    <title>Creating Network Interface Configuration Files</title>

    <para>Which interfaces are brought up and down by the network script
    usually depends on the files in <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/etc/sysconfig/</filename>.  This directory should
    contain a file for each interface to be configured, such as
    <filename moreinfo="none">ifconfig.xyz</filename>, where <quote>xyz</quote> should describe
    the network card.  The interface name (e.g. eth0) is usually appropriate.
    Inside this file are attributes to this interface, such as its IP
    address(es), subnet masks, and so forth.  It is necessary that the stem of
    the filename be <emphasis>ifconfig</emphasis>.</para>

    <note><para>If the procedure in the previous section was not used, udev
    will assign network card interface names based on system physical
    characteristics such as enp2s1. If you are not sure what your interface
    name is, you can always run <command moreinfo="none">ip link</command> or <command moreinfo="none">ls
    /sys/class/net</command> after you have booted your system.  
    </para></note>

    <para>The values in italics must be changed in every file to match

    <para>If the <envar>ONBOOT</envar> variable is set to <quote>yes</quote> the
    System V network script will bring up the Network Interface Card (NIC) during
    the system boot process. If set to anything but <quote>yes</quote> the NIC
    will be ignored by the network script and not be automatically brought up.
    The interface can be manually started or stopped with the
    <command moreinfo="none">ifup</command> and <command moreinfo="none">ifdown</command> commands.</para>

    <para>The <envar>IFACE</envar> variable defines the interface name,
    for example, eth0.  It is required for all network device configuration
    files. The filename extension must match this value.</para>

    <para>The <envar>SERVICE</envar> variable defines the method used for
    obtaining the IP address. The LFS-Bootscripts package has a modular IP
    assignment format, and creating additional files in the <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/lib/services/</filename> directory allows other IP
    assignment methods. This is commonly used for Dynamic Host Configuration
    Protocol (DHCP), which is addressed in the BLFS book.</para>

    <para>The <envar>GATEWAY</envar> variable should contain the default
    gateway IP address, if one is present. If not, then comment out the
    variable entirely.</para>

    <para>The <envar>PREFIX</envar> variable contains the number of
    bits used in the subnet. Each octet in an IP address is 8 bits. If the
    subnet's netmask is 255.255.255.0, then it is using the first three octets
    (24 bits) to specify the network number. If the netmask is 255.255.255.240,
    it would be using the first 28 bits.  Prefixes longer than 24 bits are
    commonly used by DSL and cable-based Internet Service Providers (ISPs).
    In this example (PREFIX=24), the netmask is 255.255.255.0. Adjust the
    <envar>PREFIX</envar> variable according to your specific subnet.
    If omitted, the PREFIX defaults to 24.</para>

    <title>How Do the System V Bootscripts Work?</title>

    <para>Linux uses a special booting facility named SysVinit that is based on a
    concept of <emphasis>run-levels</emphasis>. It can be quite different from one
    system to another, so it cannot be assumed that because things worked in one
    particular Linux distribution, they should work the same in LFS too. LFS has its
    own way of doing things, but it respects generally accepted standards.</para>
  
    <para>SysVinit (which will be referred to as <quote>init</quote> from now on)
    works using a run-levels scheme. There are seven (numbered 0 to 6) run-levels
    (actually, there are more run-levels, but they are for special cases and are
    generally not used. See <filename moreinfo="none">init(8)</filename> for more details), and
    each one of those corresponds to the actions the computer is supposed to
    perform when it starts up. The default run-level is 3. Here are the
    descriptions of the different run-levels as they are implemented:</para>

<literallayout format="linespecific" class="normal">0: halt the computer
1: single-user mode
2: multi-user mode without networking
3: multi-user mode with networking
4: reserved for customization, otherwise does the same as 3
5: same as 4, it is usually used for GUI login (like X's <command moreinfo="none">xdm</command> or KDE's <command moreinfo="none">kdm</command>)
6: reboot the computer</literallayout>

  <para>An explanation of this initialization file is in the man page for
  <emphasis>inittab</emphasis>.  For LFS, the key command that is run is
  <command moreinfo="none">rc</command>. The initialization file above will instruct
  <command moreinfo="none">rc</command> to run all the scripts starting with an S in the
  <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/etc/rc.d/rcS.d</filename> directory
  followed by all the scripts starting with an S in the <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/etc/rc.d/rc?.d</filename> directory where the question
  mark is specified by the initdefault value.</para>

  <para>As a convenience, the <command moreinfo="none">rc</command> script reads a library of
  functions in <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/lib/lsb/init-functions</filename>.
  This library also reads an optional configuration file,
  <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/sysconfig/rc.site</filename>.  Any of the system
  configuration file parameters described in subsequent sections can be
  alternatively placed in this file allowing consolidation of all system
  parameters in this one file.</para>

  <para>As a debugging convenience, the functions script also logs all output
  to <filename moreinfo="none">/run/var/bootlog</filename>.  Since the <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/run</filename> directory is a tmpfs, this file is not
  persistent across boots, however it is appended to the more permanent file
  <filename moreinfo="none">/var/log/boot.log</filename> at the end of the boot process.</para>

  <sect3 id="init-levels">
  <title>Changing Run Levels</title>

  <para>Changing run-levels is done with <command moreinfo="none">init
  <replaceable>&lt;runlevel&gt;</replaceable></command>, where
  <replaceable>&lt;runlevel&gt;</replaceable> is the target run-level. For example, to
  reboot the computer, a user could issue the <command moreinfo="none">init 6</command> command,
  which is an alias for the <command moreinfo="none">reboot</command> command. Likewise,
  <command moreinfo="none">init 0</command> is an alias for the <command moreinfo="none">halt</command>
  command.</para>

  <para>There are a number of directories under <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/etc/rc.d</filename> that look like <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">rc?.d</filename> (where ? is the number of the run-level) and
  <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">rcsysinit.d</filename>, all containing a number of
  symbolic links. Some begin with a <emphasis>K</emphasis>, the others begin with
  an <emphasis>S</emphasis>, and all of them have two numbers following the
  initial letter. The K means to stop (kill) a service and the S means to start a
  service. The numbers determine the order in which the scripts are run, from 00
  to 99—the lower the number the earlier it gets executed. When
  <command moreinfo="none">init</command> switches to another run-level, the appropriate services
  are either started or stopped, depending on the runlevel chosen.</para>

  <para>The real scripts are in <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/etc/rc.d/init.d</filename>. They do the actual work, and
  the symlinks all point to them. K links and S links point to
  the same script in <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/etc/rc.d/init.d</filename>.
  This is because the scripts can be called with different parameters like
  <parameter moreinfo="none">start</parameter>, <parameter moreinfo="none">stop</parameter>,
  <parameter moreinfo="none">restart</parameter>, <parameter moreinfo="none">reload</parameter>, and
  <parameter moreinfo="none">status</parameter>. When a K link is encountered, the appropriate
  script is run with the <parameter moreinfo="none">stop</parameter> argument. When an S link
  is encountered, the appropriate script is run with the
  <parameter moreinfo="none">start</parameter> argument.</para>

  <para>There is one exception to this explanation. Links that start
  with an <emphasis>S</emphasis> in the <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">rc0.d</filename> and <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">rc6.d</filename> directories will not cause anything
  to be started. They will be called with the parameter
  <parameter moreinfo="none">stop</parameter> to stop something. The logic behind this
  is that when a user is going to reboot or halt the system, nothing
  needs to be started.  The system only needs to be stopped.</para>

    <title>Udev Bootscripts</title>

      <para>The <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/rc.d/init.d/udev</filename> initscript starts
      <command moreinfo="none">udevd</command>, triggers any "coldplug" devices that have
      already been created by the kernel and waits for any rules to complete.
      The script also unsets the uevent handler from the default of
      <filename moreinfo="none">/sbin/hotplug </filename>.  This is done because the kernel no
      longer needs to call out to an external binary.  Instead
      <command moreinfo="none">udevd</command> will listen on a netlink socket for uevents that
      the kernel raises.</para>

      <para>The <command moreinfo="none">/etc/rc.d/init.d/udev_retry</command> initscript takes
      care of re-triggering events for subsystems whose rules may rely on
      filesystems that are not mounted until the <command moreinfo="none">mountfs</command>
      script is run (in particular, <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/usr</filename>
      and <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/var</filename> may cause this).  This
      script runs after the <command moreinfo="none">mountfs</command> script, so those rules
      (if re-triggered) should succeed the second time around.  It is
      configured from the <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/sysconfig/udev_retry</filename> file;
      any words in this file other than comments are considered subsystem names
      to trigger at retry time.  To find the subsystem of a device, use
      <command moreinfo="none">udevadm info --attribute-walk &lt;device&gt;</command> where
      &lt;device&gt; is an absolute path in /dev or /sys such as /dev/sr0 or
      /sys/class/rtc.</para>

    <para>The <command moreinfo="none">setclock</command> script reads the time from the hardware
    clock, also known as the BIOS or the Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor
    (CMOS) clock. If the hardware clock is set to UTC, this script will convert the

    <command moreinfo="none">hwclock</command> program which timezone to use). There is no
    way to detect whether or not the hardware clock is set to UTC, so this
    needs to be configured manually.</para>

    <para>The <command moreinfo="none">setclock</command> program is run via
    <application moreinfo="none">udev</application> when the kernel detects the hardware
    capability upon boot.  It can also be run manually with the stop parameter to

    <para>If you cannot remember whether or not the hardware clock is set to UTC,
    find out by running the <userinput moreinfo="none">hwclock --localtime --show</userinput>

    clock. If this time matches whatever your watch says, then the hardware clock is
    set to local time. If the output from <command moreinfo="none">hwclock</command> is not local
    time, chances are it is set to UTC time. Verify this by adding or subtracting
    the proper amount of hours for the timezone to the time shown by
    <command moreinfo="none">hwclock</command>. For example, if you are currently in the MST
    timezone, which is also known as GMT -0700, add seven hours to the local

  <para>This section discusses how to configure the <command moreinfo="none">console</command>
  bootscript that sets up the keyboard map, console font, and console kernel log
  level. If non-ASCII characters (e.g., the copyright sign, the British pound
  sign and Euro symbol) will not be used and the keyboard is a U.S. one, much
  of this section can be skipped. Without the configuration file, (or
  equivalent settings in <filename moreinfo="none">rc.site</filename>), the
  <command moreinfo="none">console</command> bootscript will do nothing.</para>

  <para>The <command moreinfo="none">console</command> script reads the
  <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/sysconfig/console</filename> file for configuration
  information.  Decide which keymap and screen font will be used. Various
  language-specific HOWTOs can also help with this, see <ulink url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/HOWTO-INDEX/other-lang.html"/>. If still in
  doubt, look in the <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/usr/share/keymaps</filename>
  and <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/usr/share/consolefonts</filename> directories
  for valid keymaps and screen fonts. Read <filename moreinfo="none">loadkeys(1)</filename> and
  <filename moreinfo="none">setfont(8)</filename> manual pages to determine the correct
  arguments for these programs.</para>

  <para>The <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/sysconfig/console</filename> file should contain lines
  of the form: VARIABLE="value". The following variables are recognized:</para>
  <variablelist>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>LOGLEVEL</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>This variable specifies the log level for kernel messages sent
        to the console as set by <command moreinfo="none">dmesg -n</command>. Valid levels are
        from "1" (no messages) to "8". The default level is "7".</para>

    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>KEYMAP</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>This variable specifies the arguments for the
        <command moreinfo="none">loadkeys</command> program, typically, the name of keymap
        to load, e.g., <quote>it</quote>. If this variable is not set, the
        bootscript will not run the <command moreinfo="none">loadkeys</command> program,
        and the default kernel keymap will be used.  Note that a few keymaps
        have multiple versions with the same name (cz and its variants in
        qwerty/ and qwertz/, es in olpc/ and qwerty/, and trf in fgGIod/ and
        qwerty/). In these cases the parent directory should also be specified
        (e.g. qwerty/es) to ensure the proper keymap is loaded.

    <varlistentry>
      <term>KEYMAP_CORRECTIONS</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>This (rarely used) variable
        specifies the arguments for the second call to the
        <command moreinfo="none">loadkeys</command> program. This is useful if the stock keymap
        is not completely satisfactory and a small adjustment has to be made. E.g.,
        to include the Euro sign into a keymap that normally doesn't have it,
        set this variable to <quote>euro2</quote>.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>FONT</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>This variable specifies the arguments for the
        <command moreinfo="none">setfont</command> program. Typically, this includes the font
        name, <quote>-m</quote>, and the name of the application character
        map to load. E.g., in order to load the <quote>lat1-16</quote> font
        together with the <quote>8859-1</quote> application character map
        (as it is appropriate in the USA),
        <!-- because of the copyright sign -->
        set this variable to <quote>lat1-16 -m 8859-1</quote>.
        In UTF-8 mode, the kernel uses the application character map for
        conversion of composed 8-bit key codes in the keymap to UTF-8, and thus
        the argument of the "-m" parameter should be set to the encoding of the
        composed key codes in the keymap.</para>

      <para>Some keymaps have dead keys (i.e., keys that don't produce a
      character by themselves, but put an accent on the character produced
      by the next key) or define composition rules (such as: <quote>press
      Ctrl+. A E to get Æ</quote> in the default keymap).
      Linux-5.13.12 interprets dead keys and composition rules in the
      keymap correctly only when the source characters to be composed together
      are not multibyte. This deficiency doesn't affect keymaps for European
      languages, because there accents are added to unaccented ASCII
      characters, or two ASCII characters are composed together. However, in
      UTF-8 mode it is a problem; e.g., for the Greek language, where one
      sometimes needs to put an accent on the letter <quote>alpha</quote>.
      The solution is either to avoid the use of UTF-8, or to install the
      X window system that doesn't have this limitation in its input
      handling.</para>

    <listitem>
      <para>For Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and some other languages, the Linux

      <title>Customizing the Boot and Shutdown Scripts</title>
  
      <para>The LFS boot scripts boot and shut down a system in a fairly
      efficient manner, but there are a few tweaks that you can make in the
      rc.site file to improve speed even more and to adjust messages according
      to your preferences. To do this, adjust the settings in
      the <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/sysconfig/rc.site</filename> file above.</para>
  
      <itemizedlist>
  
      <listitem><para>During the boot script <filename moreinfo="none">udev</filename>, there is
      a call to <command moreinfo="none">udev settle</command> that requires some time to
      complete. This time may or may not be required depending on devices present
      in the system.  If you only have simple partitions and a single ethernet
      card, the boot process will probably not need to wait for this command.  To
      skip it, set the variable OMIT_UDEV_SETTLE=y.</para></listitem>
  
      <listitem><para>The boot script <filename moreinfo="none">udev_retry</filename> also runs
      <command moreinfo="none">udev settle</command> by default.  This command is only needed by
      default if the <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/var</filename> directory is
      separately mounted.  This is because the clock needs the file
      <filename moreinfo="none">/var/lib/hwclock/adjtime</filename>.  Other customizations may
      also need to wait for udev to complete, but in many installations it is not
      needed.  Skip the command by setting the variable OMIT_UDEV_RETRY_SETTLE=y.
      </para></listitem>
  
      <listitem><para>By default, the file system checks are silent.  This can
      appear to be a delay during the bootup process.  To turn on the

      </para></listitem>
  
      <listitem><para>When rebooting, you may want to skip the filesystem check,
      <command moreinfo="none">fsck</command>, completely.  To do this, either create the file
      <filename moreinfo="none">/fastboot</filename> or reboot the system with the command
      <command moreinfo="none">/sbin/shutdown -f -r now</command>.  On the other hand, you can
      force all file systems to be checked by creating
      <filename moreinfo="none">/forcefsck</filename> or running <command moreinfo="none">shutdown</command> with
      the <parameter moreinfo="none">-F</parameter> parameter instead of <parameter moreinfo="none">-f</parameter>.

      again.  This process is repeated in the <command moreinfo="none">sendsignals</command>
      script for any processes that are not shut down by their own scripts.  The
      delay for <command moreinfo="none">init</command> can be set by passing a parameter.  For

  </indexterm>

  <para>The shell program <command moreinfo="none">/bin/bash</command> (hereafter referred to
  as <quote>the shell</quote>) uses a collection of startup files to help
  create an environment to run in. Each file has a specific use and may affect
  login and interactive environments differently. The files in the <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/etc</filename> directory provide global settings. If an
  equivalent file exists in the home directory, it may override the global
  settings.</para>

  <para>An interactive login shell is started after a successful login, using
  <command moreinfo="none">/bin/login</command>, by reading the <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/passwd</filename>
  file. An interactive non-login shell is started at the command-line (e.g.,
  <prompt moreinfo="none">[prompt]$</prompt><command moreinfo="none">/bin/bash</command>). A non-interactive
  shell is usually present when a shell script is running. It is non-interactive
  because it is processing a script and not waiting for user input between
  commands.</para>

  <para>For more information, see <command moreinfo="none">info bash</command> under the
  <emphasis>Bash Startup Files and Interactive Shells</emphasis> section.</para>

  <para>The files <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/profile</filename> and
  <filename moreinfo="none">~/.bash_profile</filename> are read when the shell is
  invoked as an interactive login shell.</para>

  <para>The base <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/profile</filename> below sets some
  environment variables necessary for native language support. Setting
  them properly results in:</para>

  <itemizedlist>

      <para>The output of programs translated into the native language</para>

  <para>Replace <replaceable>&lt;ll&gt;</replaceable> below with the two-letter code
  for the desired language (e.g., <quote>en</quote>) and
  <replaceable>&lt;CC&gt;</replaceable> with the two-letter code for the appropriate
  country (e.g., <quote>GB</quote>). <replaceable>&lt;charmap&gt;</replaceable> should
  be replaced with the canonical charmap for your chosen locale. Optional
  modifiers such as <quote>@euro</quote> may also be present.</para>

  <para>The list of all locales supported by Glibc can be obtained by running
  the following command:</para>

<screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">locale -a</userinput></screen>

  <para>Charmaps can have a number of aliases, e.g., <quote>ISO-8859-1</quote>
  is also referred to as <quote>iso8859-1</quote> and <quote>iso88591</quote>.
  Some applications cannot handle the various synonyms correctly (e.g., require
  that <quote>UTF-8</quote> is written as <quote>UTF-8</quote>, not
  <quote>utf8</quote>), so it is safest in most
  cases to choose the canonical name for a particular locale. To determine
  the canonical name, run the following command, where <replaceable>&lt;locale
  name&gt;</replaceable> is the output given by <command moreinfo="none">locale -a</command> for
  your preferred locale (<quote>en_GB.iso88591</quote> in our example).</para>

<screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">LC_ALL=<replaceable>&lt;locale name&gt;</replaceable> locale charmap</userinput></screen>

  <para>For the <quote>en_GB.iso88591</quote> locale, the above command
  will print:</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><computeroutput moreinfo="none">ISO-8859-1</computeroutput></screen>

  <para>This results in a final locale setting of <quote>en_GB.ISO-8859-1</quote>.
  It is important that the locale found using the heuristic above is tested prior
  to it being added to the Bash startup files:</para>

<screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">LC_ALL=&lt;locale name&gt; locale language
LC_ALL=&lt;locale name&gt; locale charmap
LC_ALL=&lt;locale name&gt; locale int_curr_symbol
LC_ALL=&lt;locale name&gt; locale int_prefix</userinput></screen>

  <para>The above commands should print the language name, the character
  encoding used by the locale, the local currency, and the prefix to dial
  before the telephone number in order to get into the country. If any of the
  commands above fail with a message similar to the one shown below, this means
  that your locale was either not installed in <xref linkend="ch-system-glibc"/> 
  or is not supported by the default installation of Glibc.</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><computeroutput moreinfo="none">locale: Cannot set LC_* to default locale: No such file or directory</computeroutput></screen>

  <para>If this happens, you should either install the desired locale using the
  <command moreinfo="none">localedef</command> command, or consider choosing a different locale.
  Further instructions assume that there are no such error messages from
  Glibc.</para>

  <!-- FIXME: the xlib example will became obsolete real soon -->
  <!--<para>Some packages beyond LFS may also lack support for your chosen locale. One
  example is the X library (part of the X Window System), which outputs the
  following error message if the locale does not exactly match one of the character
  map names in its internal files:</para>

<screen><computeroutput>Warning: locale not supported by Xlib, locale set to C</computeroutput></screen>

  <para>In several cases Xlib expects that the character map will be listed in
  uppercase notation with canonical dashes. For instance, "ISO-8859-1" rather
  than "iso88591". It is also  possible to find an appropriate specification by
  removing the charmap part of the locale specification.  This can be checked
  by running the <command>locale charmap</command> command in both locales.
  For example, one would have to change "de_DE.ISO-8859-15@euro" to
  "de_DE@euro" in order to get this locale recognized by Xlib.</para>
-->
  <para>Other packages can also function incorrectly (but may not necessarily
  display any error messages) if the locale name does not meet their expectations.
  In those cases, investigating how other Linux distributions support your locale
  might provide some useful information.</para>

  <para>Once the proper locale settings have been determined, create the
  <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/profile</filename> file:</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">cat &gt; /etc/profile &lt;&lt; "EOF"
<literal moreinfo="none"># Begin /etc/profile

export LANG=<replaceable>&lt;ll&gt;_&lt;CC&gt;.&lt;charmap&gt;&lt;@modifiers&gt;</replaceable>

# End /etc/profile</literal>
EOF</userinput></screen>

  <para>The <quote>C</quote> (default) and <quote>en_US.utf8</quote> (the recommended
  one for United States English users) locales are different. <quote>C</quote>
  uses the US-ASCII 7-bit character set, and treats bytes with the high bit set
  as invalid characters. That's why, e.g., the <command moreinfo="none">ls</command> command
  substitutes them with question marks in that locale. Also, an attempt to send
  mail with such characters from Mutt or Pine results in non-RFC-conforming
  messages being sent (the charset in the outgoing mail is indicated as <quote>unknown
  8-bit</quote>). So you can use the <quote>C</quote> locale only if you are sure that
  you will never need 8-bit characters.</para>

  <para>UTF-8 based locales are not supported well by some programs.
  Work is in progress to document and, if possible, fix such problems, see
  <ulink url="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/11.0/introduction/locale-issues.html"/>.</para>

  character set of the locale, adjusted in such a way that the kernel
  understands it.  This works if the relevant character set definition (found
  under File systems -&gt; Native Language Support when configuring the kernel)
  has been compiled into the kernel or built as a module. However, if the
  character set of the locale is UTF-8, the corresponding option
  <option>iocharset=utf8</option> would make the file system case sensitive. To
  fix this, use the special option <option>utf8</option> instead of
  <option>iocharset=utf8</option>, for UTF-8 locales. The
  <quote>codepage</quote> option is also needed for vfat and smbfs filesystems.
  It should be set to the codepage number used under MS-DOS in your country.
  For example, in order to mount USB flash drives, a ru_RU.KOI8-R user would
  need the following in the options portion of its mount line in
  <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/fstab</filename>:</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><literal moreinfo="none">noauto,user,quiet,showexec,codepage=866,iocharset=koi8r</literal></screen>

  <para>The corresponding options fragment for ru_RU.UTF-8 users is:</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><literal moreinfo="none">noauto,user,quiet,showexec,codepage=866,utf8</literal></screen>

  <para>Note that using <option>iocharset</option> is the default for
  <literal moreinfo="none">iso8859-1</literal> (which keeps the file system case
  insensitive), and the <option>utf8</option> option tells
  the kernel to convert the file names using UTF-8 so they can be
  interpreted in the UTF-8 locale.</para>

  <!--note>
    <para>In the latter case, the kernel emits the following message:</para>

<screen><computeroutput>FAT: utf8 is not a recommended IO charset for FAT filesystems,
    filesystem will be case sensitive!</computeroutput></screen>

    <para>This negative recommendation should be ignored, since all other values
    of the <quote>iocharset</quote> option result in wrong display of filenames in
    UTF-8 locales.</para>
  </note-->

  <para>It is also possible to specify default codepage and iocharset values for
  some filesystems during kernel configuration. The relevant parameters
  are named
  <quote>Default NLS Option</quote> (<option>CONFIG_NLS_DEFAULT)</option>,
  <quote>Default Remote NLS Option</quote> (<option>CONFIG_SMB_NLS_DEFAULT</option>),
  <quote>Default codepage for FAT</quote> (<option>CONFIG_FAT_DEFAULT_CODEPAGE</option>), and
  <quote>Default iocharset for FAT</quote> (<option>CONFIG_FAT_DEFAULT_IOCHARSET</option>).
  There is no way to specify these settings for the
  ntfs filesystem at kernel compilation time.</para>

  <para>It is possible to make the ext3 filesystem reliable across power
  failures for some hard disk types.  To do this, add the
  <option>barrier=1</option> mount option to the appropriate entry in
  <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/fstab</filename>.  To check if the disk drive supports
  this option, run
  <ulink url="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/11.0/general/hdparm.html">hdparm</ulink>
  on the applicable disk drive.  For example, if:</para>

<screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">hdparm -I /dev/sda | grep NCQ</userinput></screen>

  <para>returns non-empty output, the option is supported.</para>

  <para>Note: Logical Volume Management (LVM) based partitions cannot use the
  <option>barrier</option> option.</para>

    we do not recommend this option. It is often better to explore all the
    configuration menus and create the kernel configuration from
    scratch.</para>

    <para>Compile the kernel image and modules:</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><userinput remap="make" moreinfo="none">make</userinput></screen>

    <para>If using kernel modules, module configuration in <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/etc/modprobe.d</filename> may be required.
    Information pertaining to modules and kernel configuration is
    located in <xref linkend="ch-config-udev"/> and in the kernel
    documentation in the <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">linux-5.13.12/Documentation</filename> directory.
    Also, <filename moreinfo="none">modprobe.d(5)</filename> may be of interest.</para>

    <para>Unless module support has been disabled in the kernel configuration,
    install the modules with:</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><userinput remap="install" moreinfo="none">make modules_install</userinput></screen>

    <para>After kernel compilation is complete, additional steps are
    required to complete the installation. Some files need to be copied to
    the <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/boot</filename> directory.</para>

    <caution>
      <para>If the host system has a separate /boot partition, the files copied
      below should go there. The easiest way to do that is to bind /boot on the
      host (outside chroot) to /mnt/lfs/boot before proceeding.  As the root
      user in the <emphasis>host system</emphasis>:</para>

<screen role="nodump" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">mount --bind /boot /mnt/lfs/boot</userinput></screen>
    </caution>

    <para>The path to the kernel image may vary depending on the platform being
    used. The filename below can be changed to suit your taste, but the stem of
    the filename should be <emphasis>vmlinuz</emphasis> to be compatible with
    the automatic setup of the boot process described in the next section.  The
    following command assumes an x86 architecture:</para>

<screen revision="sysv" format="linespecific"><userinput remap="install" moreinfo="none">cp -iv arch/x86/boot/bzImage /boot/vmlinuz-5.13.12-lfs-11.0</userinput></screen>



    <para><filename moreinfo="none">System.map</filename> is a symbol file for the kernel.
    It maps the function entry points of every function in the kernel API,
    as well as the addresses of the kernel data structures for the running
    kernel.  It is used as a resource when investigating kernel problems.
    Issue the following command to install the map file:</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><userinput remap="install" moreinfo="none">cp -iv System.map /boot/System.map-5.13.12</userinput></screen>

    <para>The kernel configuration file <filename moreinfo="none">.config</filename>
    produced by the <command moreinfo="none">make menuconfig</command> step
    above contains all the configuration selections for the kernel
    that was just compiled. It is a good idea to keep this file for future
    reference:</para>

<screen format="linespecific"><userinput remap="install" moreinfo="none">cp -iv .config /boot/config-5.13.12</userinput></screen>

    <para>Install the documentation for the Linux kernel:</para>

cp -r Documentation/* /usr/share/doc/linux-5.13.12</userinput></screen>

    <para>It is important to note that the files in the kernel source
    directory are not owned by <emphasis>root</emphasis>. Whenever a
    package is unpacked as user <emphasis>root</emphasis> (like we did
    inside chroot), the files have the user and group IDs of whatever
    they were on the packager's computer. This is usually not a problem
    for any other package to be installed because the source tree is
    removed after the installation. However, the Linux source tree is
    often retained for a long time.  Because of this, there is a chance
    that whatever user ID the packager used will be assigned to somebody
    on the machine. That person would then have write access to the kernel
    source.</para>

    <note>
      <para>In many cases, the configuration of the kernel will need to be 
      updated for packages that will be installed later in BLFS.  Unlike
      other packages, it is not necessary to remove the kernel source tree
      after the newly built kernel is installed.</para>  
    
      <para>If the kernel source tree is going to be retained, run

    <title>GRUB Naming Conventions</title>

    <para>GRUB uses its own naming structure for drives and partitions in
    the form of <emphasis>(hdn,m)</emphasis>, where <emphasis>n</emphasis>
    is the hard drive number and <emphasis>m</emphasis> is the partition
    number. The hard drive number starts from zero, but the partition number
    starts from one for normal partitions and five for extended partitions.
    Note that this is different from earlier versions where
    both numbers started from zero. For example, partition <filename class="partition" moreinfo="none">sda1</filename> is <emphasis>(hd0,1)</emphasis> to
    GRUB and <filename class="partition" moreinfo="none">sdb3</filename> is
    <emphasis>(hd1,3)</emphasis>. In contrast to Linux, GRUB does not
    consider CD-ROM drives to be hard drives. For example, if using a CD
    on <filename class="partition" moreinfo="none">hdb</filename> and a second hard drive
    on <filename class="partition" moreinfo="none">hdc</filename>, that second hard drive
    would still be <emphasis>(hd1)</emphasis>.</para>

  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>Setting Up the Configuration</title>

    <para>GRUB works by writing data to the first physical track of the
    hard disk.  This area is not part of any file system.  The programs
    there access GRUB modules in the boot partition.  The default location
    is /boot/grub/.</para>

    <para>The location of the boot partition is a choice of the user that
    affects the configuration.  One recommendation is to have a separate small
    (suggested size is 200 MB) partition just for boot information.  That way
    each build, whether LFS or some commercial distro, can access the same boot
    files and access can be made from any booted system.  If you choose to do
    this, you will need to mount the separate partition, move all files in the
    current <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/boot</filename> directory (e.g. the
    linux kernel you just built in the previous section) to the new partition.
    You will then need to unmount the partition and remount it as <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/boot</filename>.  If you do this, be sure to update
    <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/fstab</filename>.</para>

    <para>Using the current lfs partition will also work, but configuration
    for multiple systems is more difficult.</para>

    <para>Using the above information, determine the appropriate
    designator for the root partition (or boot partition, if a separate
    one is used). For the following example, it is assumed that the root
    (or separate boot) partition is <filename class="partition" moreinfo="none">sda2</filename>.</para>

    <para>Install the GRUB files into <filename class="directory" moreinfo="none">/boot/grub</filename> and set up the boot track:</para>

    <para>GRUB is an extremely powerful program and it provides a tremendous

    <caution><para>There is a command, <application moreinfo="none">grub-mkconfig</application>, that
    can write a configuration file automatically.  It uses a set of scripts in
    /etc/grub.d/ and will destroy any customizations that you make.  These scripts
    are designed primarily for non-source distributions and are not recommended for
    LFS.  If you install a commercial Linux distribution, there is a good chance
    that this program will be run.  Be sure to back up your grub.cfg file.</para></caution>

  <para>Well done! The new LFS system is installed! We wish you much
  success with your shiny new custom-built Linux system.</para>

  <para>It may be a good idea to create an
  <filename moreinfo="none">/etc/lfs-release</filename> file. By having this file, it is very
  easy for you (and for us if you need to ask for help at some point) to find
  out which LFS version is installed on the system. Create this file by
  running:</para>

<screen revision="sysv" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">echo 11.0 &gt; /etc/lfs-release</userinput></screen>



  <para>Two files describing the installed system may be used by packages
  that can be installed on the system later, either in binary form or by building
  them.</para>

  <para>The first one shows the status of your
  new system with respect to the Linux Standards Base (LSB).  To create
  this file, run:</para>

<screen revision="sysv" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">cat &gt; /etc/lsb-release &lt;&lt; "EOF"
DISTRIB_ID="Linux From Scratch"
DISTRIB_RELEASE="11.0"
DISTRIB_CODENAME="&lt;your name here&gt;"
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Linux From Scratch"
EOF</userinput></screen>



  <para>The second one contains roughly the same information, and is used
  by systemd and some graphical desktop environments.  To create
  this file, run:</para>

<screen revision="sysv" format="linespecific"><userinput moreinfo="none">cat &gt; /etc/os-release &lt;&lt; "EOF"
NAME="Linux From Scratch"
VERSION="11.0"
ID=lfs
PRETTY_NAME="Linux From Scratch 11.0"
VERSION_CODENAME="&lt;your name here&gt;"
EOF</userinput></screen>



  <para>Be sure to put some sort of customization for the fields
  'DISTRIB_CODENAME' and 'VERSION_CODENAME' to make the system uniquely
  yours.</para>

  <title>Rebooting the System</title>

  <para>Now that all of the software has been installed, it is time to reboot
  your computer. However, you should be aware of a few things. The system you
  have created in this book is quite minimal, and most likely will not have
  the functionality you would need to be able to continue forward. By installing
  a few extra packages from the BLFS book while still in our current chroot
  environment, you can leave yourself in a much better position to continue on
  once you reboot into your new LFS installation. Here are some suggestions:</para>

    terminals.</para></listitem>

    <listitem revision="sysv"><para>
    If you are in a situation where static IP configuration

  <title>Dependencies</title>

  <para>Every package built in LFS relies on one or more other packages in
  order to build and install properly. Some packages even participate in
  circular dependencies, that is, the first package depends on the second which
  in turn depends on the first. Because of these dependencies, the order in
  which packages are built in LFS is very important. The purpose of this page
  is to document the dependencies of each package built in LFS.</para>

  <para>For each package that is built, there are three, and sometimes up to
  five types of dependencies listed below. The first lists what other packages
  need to be available in order to compile and install the package in question.
  The second lists the packages that must be available when any programs or
  libraries from the package are used at runtime. The third lists what packages,
  in addition to those on the first list, need to be available in order to run
  the test suites. The fourth list of dependencies are packages that require
  this package to be built and installed in its final location before they are
  built and installed. In most cases, this is because these packages will hard
  code paths to binaries within their scripts. If not built in a certain order,
  this could result in paths of /tools/bin/[binary] being placed inside scripts
  installed to the final system. This is obviously not desirable.</para>

  <para>The last list of dependencies are optional packages that are not
  addressed in LFS, but could be useful to the user. These packages may have
  additional mandatory or optional dependencies of their own. For these
  dependencies, the recommended practice is to install them after completion of
  the LFS book and then go back and rebuild the LFS package. In several cases,
  re-installation is addressed in BLFS.</para>
